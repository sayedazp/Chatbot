Its ancient Egyptian name was �Waset�, but it is better known today by what the ancient Greeks called it: Thebes, or the Thousand-gated Thebes. The modern name �Luxor�, is derived from what the Arabs called it in 641 AD, �al-Aqsur� (the palaces), when they stood in awe of the city�s ancient temples believing they were palaces. Already during the Old Kingdom (c. 2686 - 2181 BC), �Waset� was the capital of the 4th Upper Egyptian nome (administrative unit equivalent to a governorate). King Mentuhotep II (c.2055�2004 BC) founder of the 11th Dynasty succeeded in reunifying Egypt after a period of turbulence, and he made Thebes the capital of the country, and it remained so until the reign of the first king of the 12th Dynasty, Amenemhat I (c.1985�1955 BC). Waset was the main center for the worship of the god Amun-Ra. The temple of Karnak became the seat of his throne on earth, and even with the transfer of the capital to Ithet-Tawy (near al-Lisht, between the Faiyum and Memphis) during the 12th Dynasty, Waset retained its great religious status as the center of the worship of Amun-Ra, the king of the gods.

During the 18th Dynasty (c.1550 - 1295 BC), Egypt formed a vast empire with Thebes as its capital city.This new political situation led to an influx of wealth into Egypt from foreign countries. Because of its preeminent position as the seat of the ruling king and the cult center of Amun-Re, Thebes received the largest share of this wealth. It became one of the biggest Egyptian cities, stretching for 4 kilometers in length on the eastern bank of the Nile.

Noticing that the break was recent, Sir Flinders Petrie, aware of the importance of the find, ordered a search for the missing head, which was finally discovered three weeks later.

626a7b2aa0a01aa356c140de,the netherworld,"THE NETHERWORLDAfterlife played an important role in the ancient Egyptian beliefs. The River Nile as well as the agricultural cycle had contributed to their beliefs about rebirth and resurrection. When the deceased cross over to the netherworld known as �Duat� in the ancient Egyptian language, they were reborn again and placed on Ra�s solar boat in order to emerge with him in the day. The dead person was a resurrected Osiris. Preparation for the afterlife began with the mummification process in order to ensure for the deceased his return back to life again while the Judgment began after the funeral and the arrival of the body to the tomb. The heart was weighed against the feather of Maat i.e. the symbol of truth. Those who were righteous will proceed to the fields of �Iaru�, but those of evil hearts will be devoured by the mythical creature �Ammut� who has a body of a hippo and a face of a crocodile and remain in the underworld, tied to a pole and will never emerge into daylight. Osiris was the god of the afterlife and the �Lord of the West�. That was why the dead had to traverse the rivers, lakes, and gates which led to his world. Ra�s solar boat was the means of arriving there. The good were always aided by deities to overcome any difficulties they should encounter on the way. Ancient Egyptians described their afterlife in many texts, some of them were written on the pyramid walls and inside Middle Kingdom coffins and the books of the �Imy Duat� and �Book of the Coming Forth by Day�.MUMMIFICATIONIn popular legend, the first Egyptian to be embalmed and consequently glorified was �Osiris� himself, but the English term �mummy� comes from the Arabic �mumiyah�, meaning �bitumen�. Until the spread of the Osiris cult, complete mummification process was only practised on kings and those closest to him, but from the Middle Kingdom onwards, it was made available to all who could afford it. The dry sandy desert of Egypt had a natural tendency to preserve dead bodies, allowing the body fluids to drain away and preventing the flesh from rotting. The inhabitants of Egypt must have become well aware of this in the Pre-dynastic Period, and they must have regarded the preservation of a corpse as something natural and by extension, desirable and supported by the gods.

It was also in this form that they brought him back to life. For this reason, Isis was revered as a protector of the dead in her winged form that can be seen here.

Here, he founded a new capital for the Fatimid Caliphate: Cairo (al-Qahira �the Victorious�), which thus became the fourth capital in Egypt�s Islamic Period, after al-Fustat, al-�Askar, and al-Qatai�. He established this new capital to the northeast of its predecessor, al-Qatai�. Gawhar commissioned al-Azhar mosque in (359 AH/ 970 AD). This was Cairo�s first congregational mosque, and the fourth in Islamic Egypt. The urban plan of Cairo was rectangular in shape, with al-Mu�izz Street running north-south through its center. The city�s ramparts had eight gates, with two on each side. These were al-Nasr and al-Futuh on the north, al-Barqiyya and al-Qarratin on the east, Zuwaila and al-Farag on the south, and al-Qantara and Sa�ada on the west. During the Ayyubid Period (567- 648 AH/1171 - 1250 AD), Saladin ordered the construction of the Citadel in (572 AH / 1176 AD) so it could act as both a fortress and as headquarters. Cairo entered an unprecedented age of growth and prosperity during the Mamluk Period (648 - 923 AH/ 1250 - 1517 AD).

The city of Port Sa’id was established in 1859  at the entrance to the Suez Canal.  The streets of Port Sa’id are characterized by their width, symmetry, and intersections. All the streets are parallel to the canal and they lead from the sea to the desert. In this way, the city acquired a European character, inspired by French urban planning. The city was also lit with gas lamps, and in that sense, it was truly a unique city in its time. The area where the city  has established, northeast of the Delta and overlooking the Mediterranean, was known in previous centuries as the city of al-Farma. It was located on the eastern edge of Lake Manzala, in a barren plain between the lake and the dunes. It lay 28 km from Port Sa’id and was one of Egypt’s important fortresses and trade centres.Initially, the city was divided into two main sections, each with its own distinctive features. The first section is the city itself, located directly west of the Suez Canal. Here resided foreign communities as well as a few Egyptian citizens and Arabs. The second section is an Arab city where a larger community of Arabs and Egyptians lived. Port Sa’id’s urban and administrative blueprint has greatly developed since its inception till the end of the Muhammad Ali’s Dynasty. Now it consists of seven neighbourhoods: Port Fouad, al-Sharq, al-‘Arab, al-Manakh, al-Zuhur, al-Dawahi, and al-Janub.The city also contains a number of important archaeological monuments, including the old al-Fanar building and its adjacent, al-Abbasi Mosque (the mosque of Khedive Abbas Helmi II), the Saint Eugene Church, and the Suez Canal Authority building.Suez Canal was the project that began in 1840, when Lenin Bek developed a plan to dig a canal running between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. This would provide a shorter, cheaper means of travel from Europe since it allowed big ships to commute between Suez and al-Farma. He suggested the building of some protrusions at the entrance of the canal on the Mediterranean Sea to protect it from the Nile’s sediments, which are dumped on the sea coast. Several other projects developed by several engineers followed.On January 5, 1856, Sa’id Pasha issued the second concession firman in which he renewed Ferdinand De Lesseps’ concession to dig the Suez Canal. The first concession was released on November 30, 1854, but it did not specify the location of the port.On April 25th, the International Committee held a meeting that ended with several agreements, including the decision to build a lighthouse at the entrance to guide incoming ships. The committee also decided to establish many workshops and build all the necessary facilities to construct a bridge running from Port Sa’id and across the sea. This would also serve as a dock for ships to unload their goods. On April 21st, 1859, Delessepes arrived in Port Sa’id, accompanied by Monsieur Mogel Bey, General Director, and Monsieur Laroche, along with other project heads, agents, and one hundred and fifty from sailors, workers and drivers. Monsieur De Lesseps determined that the site was suitable for the canal project.The Suez Canal was inaugurated during the reign of Khedive Ismail, in a ceremony held in 1869.

It was located on the eastern edge of Lake Manzala, in a barren plain between the lake and the dunes. It lay 28 km from Port Said and was one of Egypts important fortresses and trade centres.Initially, the city was divided into two main sections, each with its own distinctive features. The first section is the city itself, located directly west of the Suez Canal. Here resided foreign communities as well as a few Egyptian citizens and Arabs. The second section is an Arab city where a larger community of Arabs and Egyptians lived. Port Saids urban and administrative blueprint has greatly developed since its inception till the end of the Muhammad Alis Dynasty. Now it consists of seven neighbourhoods: Port Fouad, al-Sharq, al-Arab, al-Manakh, al-Zuhur, al-Dawahi, and al-Janub.The city also contains a number of important archaeological monuments, including the old al-Fanar building and its adjacent, al-Abbasi Mosque (the mosque of Khedive Abbas Helmi II), the Saint Eugene Church, and the Suez Canal Authority building.Suez Canal was the project that began in 1840, when Lenin Bek developed a plan to dig a canal running between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. This would provide a shorter, cheaper means of travel from Europe since it allowed big ships to commute between Suez and al-Farma. He suggested the building of some protrusions at the entrance of the canal on the Mediterranean Sea to protect it from the Niles sediments, which are dumped on the sea coast. Several other projects developed by several engineers followed.On January 5, 1856, Said Pasha issued the second concession firman in which he renewed Ferdinand De Lesseps concession to dig the Suez Canal. The first concession was released on November 30, 1854, but it did not specify the location of the port.On April 25th, the International Committee held a meeting that ended with several agreements, including the decision to build a lighthouse at the entrance to guide incoming ships. The committee also decided to establish many workshops and build all the necessary facilities to construct a bridge running from Port Said and across the sea. This would also serve as a dock for ships to unload their goods. On April 21st, 1859, Delessepes arrived in Port Said, accompanied by Monsieur Mogel Bey, General Director, and Monsieur Laroche, along with other project heads, agents, and one hundred and fifty from sailors, workers and drivers. Monsieur De Lesseps determined that the site was suitable for the canal project.The Suez Canal was inaugurated during the reign of Khedive Ismail, in a ceremony held in 1869. The Suez Canal Company obtained the right to manage the project and share the profits equally with the Egyptian government. This arrangement ended on July 26, 1956, with Jamal Abd al-Nasirs nationalisation of the Suez Canal Company. Port Said Historical location",147,15,0.8392871

It was cut into the living rock by King Ramesses II (the Great) of the Nineteenth Dynasty, around 1264 BC. The temple is most well known for the four imposing seated colossal statues that dominate its façade. One of these collapsed because of an ancient earthquake, and its fragments can still be seen on the ground.           Colossal standing statues of the king line the main hall, leading to the sanctuary where four deities are sat: Amun‑Ra, Ra‑Horakhty, Ptah, and a deified version of Ramesses II. The temple was built with such precision that on two days a year, the 22nd of February and 22nd of October, the sun’s rays enter the temple, cross the main hall, and illuminate the innermost statues. These dates are thought to correspond to the coronation and birthday of Ramesses II.           Another rock-cut temple to the north, known as the Small Temple, is dedicated to the goddess Hathor and Ramesses II’s Great Royal Wife, Queen Nefertari.

This was where the cult of the great god Amun of Thebes was conducted. As such, it was extremely wealthy and its priesthood held great political power.            Thebes was the city that the line of kings who reunified Egypt after the First Intermediate Period hailed from. It thus became one of the most important cities, a position that it would continue to hold throughout the majority of ancient Egyptian history.

Ancient Egyptian temples were models of the cosmos, and this layout meant that they mirrored the sun god’s trajectory through the sky. Rather uniquely, however, it also possesses a north–south axis, which orients it towards another temple, the abode of Amenemopet known today as Luxor Temple. This was a different version of Amun specific to south Luxor. The two temples were linked by a processional way lined with sphinxes.

In addition to the ancient Egyptians’ mastery of stone, which is evident everywhere in the scale of the monuments, the reliefs covering their walls, and the statues populating them, several highlights are worth mentioning.

The hall may have been begun by Amenhotep III (c.1390–1352 BC; Eighteenth Dynasty), but the decoration is from the reigns of Nineteenth Dynasty kings Sety I (c.1294–1279 BC) and his son Ramesses II (c.1279–1213 BC). A magnificent obelisk of Hatshepsut (c.1473–1458 BC) in a nearby hall stands at a colossal height of nearly 30 meters.

The statues of this god, his wife Mut, and their son Khonsu left their temples every year during the Beautiful Feast of the Valley, and crossed the Nile to visit the royal mortuary temples, including Hatshepsuts, which appears to have been one of their most important stops. Luxor Historical location","Deir al-Bahari The celebrated temple of Hatshepsut (c.14731458 BC), the queen who became Pharaoh, is located here, in Deir al-Bahari, on the west bank of Luxor. Made up of three man-made terraces that gradually rise up toward the sheer cliff face, this structure is truly a sight to behold. The site of Deir al-Bahari was sacred to Hathor, the goddess who nursed and reared every king, including their mythological ancestor, the god Horus, in Egypts primordial past. A manifestation of this goddess was believed to reside in the very hills under whose shadow lies the temple of Hatshepsut, and just on the other side of which is the site of the tombs of some of ancient Egypts most famous rulers, the Valley of the Kings. Stelae bearing prayers to Hathor depict her, in cow form, emerging from these mountains. This impressive geological formation features a summit that is naturally pyramid-shaped. This was the reason why king Nebhepetre Mentuhotep (c.20552004 BC) chose this hallowed location as the site of his tomb and mortuary temple, 600 years before Hatshepsut set foot here. Royal mortuary temples complemented tombs, and the cults of deceased kings were maintained in these structures for the continued survival of their souls in the hereafter. The most prominent feature of Mentuhoteps temple-tomb was a monumental structure, believed by some to have been a pyramid, which rose from the center of the main terrace. The temple of Hatshepsut served as a mortuary temple for the female pharaoh and her revered father, Thutmose I.

Salah al-Din Square monuments","Mosque and Madrasa of Sultan Hasan The Mosque and Madrasa of Sultan Hasan is one of the largest and architecturally exquisite mosques in all of Egypt. It was commissioned by the Mamluk sultan Hasan ibn al-Nasir Muhammad ibn Qalawun sometime between 757 AH/1356 AD and 764 AH/1363 AD, and is located at the end of Muhammad Ali Street, opposite its nineteenth century neighbor al-Rifai mosque in Midan al-Qala (Salah al-Din Square).      The historian al-Maqrizi, writing in the fifteenth century, reports on the construction of the mosque, stating that the plagues that affected the population at the time did not put an end to the completion of the mosque. The total cost of the project exceeded one million dinars. Because the project was executed on such a massive scale, it attracted many artisans and craftsmen from different provinces of the Mamluk empire.      Its proximity to the citadel ultimately resulted in its use as a fort by enemies several times throughout its history. Some sultans seriously considered demolishing it because enemy armies would use the mosques high platforms to launch attacks on the citadel.      Like most Islamic monuments in Cairo, this one has also undergone several phases of reconstruction, up until the twentieth century. The interior and exterior domes of the mosque are extremely ornate, and their designs may have been inspired by Armenian art and architecture.      A monumental iwan opens up on each of the four sides of the interior square courtyard. An iwan is a vaulted rectangular space that is open on one side.

A quay for the transport of the heavy stones has been identified at Elephantine, called El -Ahly Quay, and is believed to have been one of the primary quays used. A smaller quay was also found at El Naga El Bahari. El Naga El Bahari. sunken monument",318,29,0.9789836

In addition to many colossal statues, the pylon was also fronted by a pair of 25-meter-high obelisks made by this great king, but only one remains in place; the other has been at the Place de la Concorde in Paris since 18351836.      In the late third century AD, the Romans built a fort around the temple, and the first room beyond the hypostyle hall of Amenhotep III became its sanctuary. The original wall reliefs were covered with plaster, and painted in the Graeco-Roman artistic style, depicting Emperor Diocletian (284305 AD) and his three coregents. Although these had largely disappeared, efforts are under way to restore these to their former glory. Luxor temple",325,21,0.5317372

Upon completion, it stood 52.5 m tall. Although it was originally encased in blocks of fine limestone, its core consists of small blocks of local limestone and debris fill. This meant that, when the casing blocks were removed in antiquity, the core, unable to sustain its shape, began to droop. The pyramid appears little different from a natural hill today as a result. Its substructure, however, is intact. � � � � � A descending passageway turns into a horizontal corridor, which leads to an antechamber. Three magazines for burial equipment lie on the left, but since the pyramid was robbed in antiquity, these were found empty. On the right, west, side is the burial chamber. Its ceiling is decorated with gold stars against a dark blue background, reflecting the ancient Egyptian notion of the tomb as a microcosm of the universe. The end of the corridor, and the entirety of the antechamber and burial chamber are beautifully decorated with Pyramid Texts. These are a collection of rituals and recitations that were designed to ensure the king�s successful journey to the afterlife. The originally intended decorative programme was never completed, however, indicating the king�s untimely death.

It constitutes a significant historical turning point in ancient Egyptian funerary monuments, revolutionizing stone architecture and royal burials. In addition to its beauty and monumental scale, it is not only the very first pyramid that the ancient Egyptians ever built, but also the oldest known ancient Egyptian stone structure. The sheer age of the Step Pyramid is astounding. It was built in the early Third Dynasty, during the reign of King Netjerykhet (c.2667�2648 BC), who is now more well-known as Djoser. Before his reign, royal and elite Egyptians were buried in mastabas. This word, meaning �bench� in Arabic, refers to a type of funerary structure that was generally rectangular in shape and built over the tomb proper, which was underground. The Step Pyramid is composed of six stacked mastabas, thus creating the stepped effect. Imhotep, its architect, may very well have been responsible for this major innovation. At one end of the pyramid complex, a structure known as the South Tomb is believed to have acted as an additional, symbolic, tomb for Djoser, perhaps reflecting his role as the dual king of both Upper and Lower Egypt.

The rest of decoration of the tomb depict either the funeral, or Tutankhamun in the company of various deities.      This small size of the tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62) has led to much speculation. When his successor, the high official Ay, died, he was buried in a tomb (KV23), which may have been originally intended for Tutankhamun, but which had not yet been completed at the time of the death of the young king. The same argument has been made in turn for the tomb of Ays successor, Horemheb (KV57). If so, it is unclear for whom the eventual tomb of Tutankhamun, KV62, was carved, but it has been argued that it existed already, either as a private tomb or as a storage area, that was subsequently enlarged to receive the king.     Whatever the reason, the small size of the tomb meant that the approximately 3,500 artefacts that were discovered inside were stacked very tightly. These reflect the lifestyle of the royal palace, and included objects that Tutankhamun would have used in his daily life, such as clothes, jewelry, cosmetics, incense, furniture, chairs, toys, vessels made of a variety of materials, chariots, and weapons.
