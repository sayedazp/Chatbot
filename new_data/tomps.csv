As vizier, the highest-ranking official, and husband of a daughter of Teti�s, Mereruka was a very powerful and wealthy man. It is all the more significant that he held this title during the reigns of the first two rulers of the Sixth Dynasty, a time when the elite�s power had grown substantially. � � � � � Mereruka was buried in a mastaba to the north of the pyramid of Teti in Saqqara. Reflecting his status, it is among the largest in the Teti cemetery, and among the most exquisitely decorated tombs of the Old Kingdom (c.2686�2181 BC). The rooms inside the mastaba were often the venue for the performance of the cult for the soul of the tomb owner. Mereruka�s massive mastaba contains a total of thirty rooms, including five for his wife, and another five for his son. � � � � � �Many beautiful scenes adorning the walls of this tomb provide insight into life during the Old Kingdom, such as the herding of cattle through marshes, the harpooning of hippopotami, and fishing and fowling scenes, all of which are shown in amazingly vivid detail. Also shown are scenes of animals being force-fed, although exceptionally hyenas are depicted among them. A unique scene depicts personifications of the three seasons of the ancient Egyptian calendar. The focal point of the entire tomb was the false-door. In Mereruka�s mastaba, a life-size statue of him steps out, ready to receive the offerings that were set on the offering table before him.","

It is a monumental structure that dwarfs the surrounding landscape. The mosque gets its name from imam Ahmad al-Rifa�i (512�578�AH/1118�1181/2�AD), who founded the Rifa�i tariqa (Sufi path). Although he was never buried here, the mosque is the site of joyous annual Sufi celebrations commemorating his birth. � � � � � The original structure was a Fatimid mosque, which was then transformed into a shrine for Ali abu Sheibak. Finally, Ottoman queen Kosheir Hanim commissioned the current design of the mosque and put in charge of the construction the architect Hussein Pasha Fahmi. Part of the plan was to have a mausoleum for the royal family as part of the extension, which was made by imported building materials from Europe, such as Italian marble. In addition to traditional raw materials, cement has also been employed in the construction of the mosque�a first for any Islamic monument in Egypt�signaling the transition into modern times. � � � � � Al-Rifa�i Mosque�s architectural design is as interesting as its construction history. Visitors stand in awe of the detailed decoration of the outer walls and massive columns of the outer gate. The minarets are distinguished by their beauty and elegance. � � � � � While a section of the mosque is dedicated to prayers, another is reserved for the members of the family of Muhammad Ali Pasha, which was in power from the early nineteenth century until the 1952 revolution, when the modern Egyptian republic was born. Khedive Ismail and his mother Hoshiyar Qadin, as well as Kings Fuad I and Faruq, the last two rulers of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty, are buried here, all enshrined in elaborate tombs. The mosque briefly also served as the burial place of Reza Shah (king) of Iran (d.1363 AH/1944 AD), but he was returned to his home country following the end of World War II. Part of his burial chamber, however, is occupied by his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (d. 1400 AH/1980 AD), the last Shah of Iran.","

This was where the workers who built the pyramid complexes of Khafre (c.2558 2532 BC) and Menkaure (c.2532 2503 BC) lived. The tantalising remains of an even older settlement underneath may date to Khufus reign (c.2589 2566 BC). Houses, magazines, three main streets, and a royal administrative building were discovered within the city walls, as were four huge galleries. These may have been the barracks in which the workers who built the pyramids slept and prepared their food. An enormous amount of fish, bird, cattle, sheep, goat, and pig bones were found, revealing that the state ensured that the workers were in good health so they could fulfill their physically demanding responsibilities. On the hillside immediately to the west of Heit al-Ghurab is the towns cemetery. Low-ranking overseers of workmen were buried in modest mastabas on the low slopes of the hill, surrounded by even smaller mastaba or domed tombs, possibly those of their extended families and the workers they supervised. These were largely built of mudbrick, whereas the higher-ranking overseers and skilled craftsmen were buried in large stone mastabas higher up the slope. Among these is the beautifully decorated tomb of the overseer of linen, the overseer of the royal house of purification, Nefertheith. The majority of the bodies discovered show evidence of hard physical labor, many even featuring broken bones. Most of these had healed correctly, however, indicating that, in addition to being well-fed, the workers also received very good medical care.","

It constitutes a significant historical turning point in ancient Egyptian funerary monuments, revolutionizing stone architecture and royal burials. In addition to its beauty and monumental scale, it is not only the very first pyramid that the ancient Egyptians ever built, but also the oldest known ancient Egyptian stone structure. The sheer age of the Step Pyramid is astounding. It was built in the early Third Dynasty, during the reign of King Netjerykhet (c.2667�2648 BC), who is now more well-known as Djoser. Before his reign, royal and elite Egyptians were buried in mastabas. This word, meaning �bench� in Arabic, refers to a type of funerary structure that was generally rectangular in shape and built over the tomb proper, which was underground. The Step Pyramid is composed of six stacked mastabas, thus creating the stepped effect. Imhotep, its architect, may very well have been responsible for this major innovation. At one end of the pyramid complex, a structure known as the South Tomb is believed to have acted as an additional, symbolic, tomb for Djoser, perhaps reflecting his role as the dual king of both Upper and Lower Egypt. Djoser�s pyramid complex also has some unique features. The two courts in front of the pyramid recreate the setting of the Sed Festival, a royal ceremony aimed at rejuvenating the king and regenerating his power. The structures on the side of the eastern court emulate in stone the ephemeral shrines that were used in this festival, thus ensuring that the king could continue being rejuvenated forever.","

The bulls were treated with a lot of privilege during their life. Upon death, the bulls were mummified and placed in sarcophagi in an elaborate celebration.

The development of Alexandrian tombs can be traced here, from modest shaft graves, through gallery tombs, to the monumental hypogea. � � � � � The Alexandrian hypogeum consisted of a group of underground chambers cut into the bedrock around an open court where the funerary rituals were conducted. Some chambers featured bed-shaped sarcophagi called kline, after �bed� in Greek, but most contained loculi, rectangular burial niches carved into the walls. Many burials consisted of a niche housing an urn containing the remains of the deceased after cremation, a tradition that was imported from Greece. � � � � � The majority of what is visible in Shatby today are the ruins of a hypogeum built around 280�BC. It was apparently constructed for a single family, which then employed and expanded it over the course of several generations. Although much of the original decoration is not preserved, enough survives that gives tantalizing hints of the hypogeum�s past grandeur. Many of the walls are sculpted, featuring cornices, engaged columns, and solid, pseudo-windows. Painted garlands once hung between the engaged columns of the court, and painted birds flew against a sky-blue backdrop, providing a simulated beautiful outdoor setting for the funerary rituals that were conducted there. � � � � � The kline of the hypogeum, carved out of the bedrock, feature all the parts expected of a bed, including mattress and cushions, in a poignant allegory of death as protracted sleep. Kline, also used for banqueting, afforded the deceased life�s pleasures in death, and transformed the tomb into a home for eternity.","

The exquisitely painted sunk relief walls are very well preserved. A decline in the quality of the decoration since the Nineteenth Dynasty (c.1295�1186 BC) is evident, however. � � � � � The tomb�s decorative programme consists of various funerary texts to help the king in his successful transition to the afterlife. The first descending passages are decorated with the Book of Gates, Book of Caverns, and Books of the Heavens. The passages beyond bear scenes from the Amduat, the Book of the Dead, and the Books of the Heavens, and scenes from the Book of the Earth adorn the burial chamber. All ceilings are decorated with astronomical scenes and texts. Some of these funerary texts are collections of spells, and others are maps of the underworld, describing the sun god�s daily nocturnal journey through it.

Its discovery in 1922 by Howard Carter made headlines worldwide, and continued to do so as the golden artifacts and other luxurious objects discovered in this tomb were being brought out. The tomb and its treasures are iconic of Egypt, and the discovery of the tomb is still considered one of the most important archaeological discoveries to date. � � � � �Despite the riches it contained, the tomb of Tutankhamun, number 62 in the Valley of the Kings, is in fact quite modest compared to the other tombs on this site, in both size and decoration. This is most likely due to Tutankhamun having come to the throne very young, and even then ruling for only around ten years in total. One can wonder at what riches the much larger tombs of the most powerful kings of the New Kingdom, such as Hatshepsut, Thutmose III, Amenhotep III, and Ramesses II once contained. � � � � � Only the walls of the burial chamber bear any decoration. Unlike most previous and later royal tombs, which are richly decorated with funerary texts like the Amduat or Book of Gates, which helped the deceased king reach the afterlife, only a single scene from the Amduat is represented in the tomb of Tutankhamun. The rest of decoration of the tomb depict either the funeral, or Tutankhamun in the company of various deities. � � � � � This small size of the tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62) has led to much speculation. When his successor, the high official Ay, died, he was buried in a tomb (KV23), which may have been originally intended for Tutankhamun, but which had not yet been completed at the time of the death of the young king. The same argument has been made in turn for the tomb of Ay�s successor, Horemheb (KV57). If so, it is unclear for whom the eventual tomb of Tutankhamun, KV62, was carved, but it has been argued that it existed already, either as a private tomb or as a storage area, that was subsequently enlarged to receive the king. � � � � �Whatever the reason, the small size of the tomb meant that the approximately 3,500 artefacts that were discovered inside were stacked very tightly. These reflect the lifestyle of the royal palace, and included objects that Tutankhamun would have used in his daily life, such as clothes, jewelry, cosmetics, incense, furniture, chairs, toys, vessels made of a variety of materials, chariots, and weapons.","

The entrance to Khnumhoteps tomb chapel is in the form of a portico with two columns, and is set in a forecourt. The forecourt itself was once reached by a long causeway that ran up the hill and whose course can still be seen thanks to the boulders on either side of it. The portico has two fluted columns. These columns are in the proto-Doric style, so called due to its resemblance to the much later Ancient Greek Doric column style. The chapel contains two burial shafts and was designed with two rows of two columns, probably laid out in square formation around the centre of the tomb chapel and ending in front of the statue shrine. Khnumhoteps life is recorded in 222 columns of text which run across the lower section of the chapel walls. On either side of the statue shrine, painted scenes also show him fishing and fowling in the marshes. The most famous scene in this tomb, however, is on the north wall, to the left of the entrance: a delegation of 37 Amu (people who lived to the east and north-east of Egypt) consisting of men, women, and children dressed in beautiful, colorful clothing bringing eye-paint to Khnumhotep. The head of the delegation has his own caption, which gives us his name, Absha, and which describes him as a heqa khaset ruler of a foreign land. This is the oldest known example of the word that is far better known today in its Greek form, Hyksos. On the west wall, on your left directly after entering the tomb chapel, you will notice a fascinating scene depicting three monkeys helping fruit gatherers collect figs from the tree!","

The term mastaba (Arabic for �bench�) refers to a type of funerary structure that was generally rectangular in shape and built over the tomb proper, which was underground. Most of the mastabas of the Eastern and Western Cemeteries were built during the reign of Khufu, in tandem with his pyramid complex, whereas the rock-cut tombs were for the most part built later. ����������� Most of the tombs of the Eastern Cemetery dating to the reign of Khufu were intended for his closest relatives. The rock-cut tomb of his mother, queen Hetepheres I, along with her funerary equipment, was discovered here, and it is the site of the mastaba of his half-brother Ankh-haf, who had an important administrative position in the construction of the Great Pyramid. On the other hand, the mastabas of the Western Cemetery, which are mostly arranged in an orderly grid, were reserved for very high-ranking noblemen that were not as closely related to the king. Among them is the monumental mastaba of Hemiunu, who oversaw the building of the Great Pyramid.","

It is a unique jewel of Islamic architecture, located in the Mamluk cemetery. It displays elements typical of Mamluk architecture, although built in the late nineteenth century AD. Its founder was Amina Hanim Elhami, wife of Khedive Tawfiq. She built it to serve as a burial place for the royal family. The dome had an iron gate that betokens the greatness of this time and place. It was characterised by its floral designs. In front of it is a garden, at the centre of which is a passageway leading to the main burial and some chambers. Additionally, the structure houses a variety of artefacts, carpets, and lavish candlesticks. The dome contains many tombs, including that of Banba Qadin (one of Muhammad Alis� wives), Amina Hanim Elhami, Khedive Muhammad Tawfiq Pasha, Khedive Abbas Helmy II, and Prince Muhammad Ali Tawfiq. The burials are covered with marble and wood, and they bear inscriptions and botanical designs which are gilded, coloured, and inlaid with ivory. The tomb of the Egyptian scholar, Doctor Ali Mustafa Mashrafa, was moved to the garden of this cemetery. The dome was restored in 2008 under the auspices of his highness former prince Abbas Helmi III. He constructed a burial place for himself so that he may be laid to rest near his ancestors.","

This magnificent complex is the oldest stone building of the ancient world. Basically, it was named the �Southern Tomb� following its discovery by the English archaeologist Cecil Malaby Firth in 1928. Significantly, the tomb is composed of an upper level in the form of a rectangular stone building. Its walls are decorated with a series of stone sockets in the form of entrances and exits, crowned by a frieze of cobra heads that symbolize protection and power. Regarding the lower level of the tomb represents an entrance towards a ramp leading to the burial chamber, which is located at the bottom of a great shaft measuring 7.5 x 7.5 m, and with a depth of approximately 31 m, including a huge sarcophagus made of 16 blocks of pink granite, each measuring approximately 3.60 metres high, 3.5 metres wide, and 3.6 metres long. �Furthermore, one can note the similarity between the well and the sarcophagus with those inside the step pyramid. One of the most important architectural and decorative elements of the Southern Tomb are a series of corridors, one of which contains three false doors, each topped with exquisite reliefs depicting the king taking part in the Heb-Sed Festival. This was a vital event, a royal jubilee, with the aim to rejuvenate the king and renew his right to rule. One can admire the king here being represented wearing the royal beard, as well as the White Crown of Upper Egypt, and several walls of the southern tomb�s corridors are decorated with the same blue faience tiles into the step pyramid. Various theories have been proposed about this tomb, as it is believed that it belonged to the royal wife of the king, or that it was built in order to house the internal organs of the king (lungs, stomach, intestines and liver).","

Facing the entrance: 122 pairs of wrestlers in five registers (sections) are locked in combat, no two in the same position. Below them, the beleaguered defenders of a fortress are fighting off their attackers. The north wall (to the left of the entrance) depicts, as is usual for the tombs in the upper cemetery at Beni Hasan, scenes of wild animal hunting in the desert. In the registers below these, depictions of barbers, carpentry, a scene of a statue being sculpted of the deceased and his wife alongside scenes of funeral rituals, and spinning and weaving can all be seen, in addition to scenes of men playing board games, and young women juggling and performing acrobatics. All of these activities are presided over by Khety and his wife, who can be seen further down this wall. The south wall also depicts the wine making process, and scenes of listening to music and performing different sports.","

There, a small shrine was added in the south-eastern corner (at the far end, on the right), with a false door carved on its west wall and an offering platform in front of it. The walls of the tomb, like those of others tombs at Beni Hasan, have a decorative frieze at the top, which the ancient Egyptians called a kheker. As is standard for tombs in the upper cemetery at Beni Hasan, the north wall (the one left of the entrance) depicts scenes of hunting in the desert. This same wall, as in the tomb of Khety, depicts scenes of everyday life: here, barbers, sandal makers, goldsmiths, spinners, and weavers can all be seen, in addition to a scene showing tax collection, in which defaulters are being brought by force before a scribe. Also interesting is the lowest register which, alongside fishing, depicts different species of fish and flying creatures, mostly birds, but bats, too. More animals can be seen on the south wall, where a cat is facing a mouse, and below them, accompanied by a male monkey, a female monkey is carrying a young monkey on her back. Two baboons can also be seen next to the monkeys. The east wall of the tomb depicts a battle and a besieged fortress, and 220 pairs of wrestlers. In each pair, one wrestler is painted red and the other dark brown, so that the interaction between the two men can be seen clearly.","

With its original height of 146.5 meters, it was the tallest structure in the world for 3,800 years. The Great Pyramid still remains the last surviving member of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and took an estimated to 10 to 20 years to build. To this day, it is not entirely certain how this was done. � � � � � � The Great Pyramid is made of local limestone, but its exterior was once entirely covered with high quality limestone. These casing stones were brought from Tura, south of Maadi, by ship. On the inside, the pyramid has three chambers, one cut into the bedrock underneath, and two high up within the masonry itself, a feature that no other pyramid possesses. The sarcophagus in which Khufu was once laid to rest can still be seen in the upper of these two rooms, the King�s Chamber. This room is accessed through the Grand Gallery, a majestic corbelled ascending passage, and a masterpiece of ancient engineering and architecture. � � � � � � Two large and impressive ships were discovered in pits on the south side of the pyramid in a dismantled state. These are believed to have been used to transport the royal mummy and burial equipment to the tomb. The eastern ship has since been reconstructed, and is on display in the Boat Museum, directly above the pit in which it was found.","

This cemetery was reserved for the closest relatives of the king, and contains some of the largest mastabas on the Giza Plateau. The term mastaba (Arabic for �bench�) refers to a type of funerary structure that was generally rectangular in shape and built over the tomb proper, which was underground. The mastaba of Khufukhaf I includes two burial shafts, one for him, and another for his wife, Neferetkau. ����������� The chapel of Khufukhaf I, inside the mastaba, where his funerary cult was conducted, is very well preserved. Many beautiful scenes survive that show him and his wife receiving a wide variety of offerings, which they would both need in the afterlife. ����������� A scene in the chapel depicts him holding his mother�s hand. The hieroglyphic inscriptions beside her reveal that she was the mother of a king, but her name is missing. It is thought that this is Henutsen, one of Khufu�s wives, who is believed to have been buried in one of the three queens� pyramids next-door. The inscriptions in Khufukhaf I�s mastaba also identify him as a vizier, the highest-ranking official in ancient Egyptian administration. As a vizier and the son of a queen, there is no doubt that Khufukhaf I was one of the most powerful people in the kingdom during his lifetime.","

Sety I (c.1294�1279 BC) was the second king of the Nineteenth Dynasty, and father of Ramesses II (the Great). His tomb, number 17 in the Valley of the Kings, is sometimes called �Belzoni�s tomb� after its discoverer. � � � � � Like the other tombs in the Valley of the Kings, the tomb of Sety I is decorated with various funerary texts, the aim of which was to ensure his successful transition to the afterlife. The tomb of Sety I was the first tomb in the Valley of the Kings to be entirely decorated. The elegant painted scenes and reliefs are of the exquisite quality that the reign of Sety I is so well known for. The funerary texts attested there are the Litany of Re, Amduat, and Book of Gates, in addition to the Book of the Divine Cow and the gorgeous astronomical scenes decorating the ceiling of his burial chamber, simulating the night sky. � � � � � Architecturally, the tomb of Sety I falls under the �joggled axis� type characteristic of his period. The first series of corridors and descending passageways terminate into the first pillared room, where, in the facing wall, but off-axis, another series of descending passageways cut into the floor of the room lead to the burial chamber. The tomb does feature a number of new and unique characteristics. Along the same axis of the first series of corridors and descending passageways, a doorway leads into a single room. This may have been intended to lead intruders to believe that this was the actual burial chamber. The tomb of Sety I is also the first tomb to possess a burial chamber with a vaulted ceiling. Perhaps most interesting of all is the passage begins in the floor of the burial chamber, descending even further, deep into the earth. It is believed that this was intended to ritually connect the tomb of Sety I with the primeval and regenerative powers of the underworld. � � � � �In 1821, painted recreations of several rooms from the tomb of Sety I were displayed in the Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly in London. This exhibition, put together by the discoverer of the tomb, Giovanni Battista Belzoni, made an ancient Egyptian tomb available to various members of the public. It captured people�s imagination, and is one of the first monuments responsible for attracting popular attention to ancient Egypt.","
