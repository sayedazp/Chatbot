The vast majority of the ancient Egyptian monuments that can still be visited there today were built during the New Kingdom (c.1550–1069 BC), Egypt’s age of empire. Ancient Thebes and its necropolis, or burial areas, were added to UNESCO’s World Heritage List in 1979. The monuments that may be seen here are the Karnak temple complex and Luxor Temple on the east bank of the Nile, and those on the west bank include the temple of Ramesses III in Medinet Habu; the Ramesseum of Ramesses II; Amenhotep III’s Colossi of Memnon; the temple of Hatshepsut in Deir al-Bahari; the tombs in the Valley of the Kings, where Tutankhamun was buried; the tombs in the Valley of the Queens; and the town and tombs of the workmen of the royal tombs in Deir al-Medina.
The Sphinx Avenue ,Sphinx Avenue is one of the most significant archaeological parts of the ancient city of Thebes (Luxor), the Avenue is around 2,700 meters long, that connects Karnak Temples in the north with Luxor Temple in the south.The Sphinx Avenue was built by ancient Egyptian kings between the Eighteenth Dynasty and Thirtieth Dynasty as a processional way for sacred ceremonies and festivals. Along the Avenue, unparalleled Sphinxes line up along the ancient road from Karnak Temples to Luxor Temple. Excavations started in the Sphinx Avenue Since 1949 and continued for around 70 years by Egyptian Archaeologists who made a glory discovering more sphinxes and parts of the road.
The Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities started in 2017 a project to restore the Sphinx Avenue and connect Karnak Temples and Luxor Temple. The project came as a revival of the ancient road that retain its glory two thousand years ago. The Sphinx Avenue is now another spectacular monument of the city of hundred gates..

Said to have been founded by the legendary first king of Egypt Menes in 3100 BC, the ancient city of Memphis was the capital during the Early Dynastic Period (c.3100–2686 BC) and Old Kingdom (c.2686–2181 BC), and continued to be one of the most important cities throughout more than three-thousand years of ancient Egyptian history. It was a center for the worship of the god Ptah, whose temple was one of the most important places in all of ancient Egypt. It was so important, that the origin of the word “Egypt”, from Greek Aigyptos, comes from the temple’s ancient name, Hikuptah “The Temple of the ka (‘soul’) of Ptah.
The city’s longevity is reflected in the sheer size and number of the many ancient cemeteries in its area. These include, from north to south, Abu Rawash; the Giza Plateau, the site of the three world-famous Pyramids of Giza; Zawyet al-‘Aryan; Abu Ghurab; Abusir; Saqqara; Mit Rahina; and Dahshur. A recent discovery for worker’s village near by the pyramids at Giza plateau has revealed a lot about the life of the pyramid’s builders . The village seemed to had both permanent and seasonal workers, mostly with their families, it is thought the permanent inhabitant was about 5,000 people but it reached around 20.000 during a certain period of time with the seasonal builders.
Despite their large number, the workers’ village was very well equipped and provided by the state. It had houses, bakeries, craftsmen workshops, administrative building, massive canteen, and larger residences for the foreman. Barracks were discovered that could have been accommodated up to 2,000 people at one time, and may have been used by the seasonal workers.Based on animal bones found at the site, 2, 000 kilograms of meat were slaughtered every day to feed the builders and their families, slaughtered animals included sheep, goats, and cows. The workers also ate vegetables, lentils, fish, bread and beer.
A cemetery discovered near the village gave us an idea about their tombs, which were built in various styles including small pyramids; it indicates that they came from different regions. And it seems that they have taken small fragments of the expensive stones they used in their work and used them in their tombs.
A study of the remaining of their bodies (mostly bones) revealed that they received medical treatment for their injuries.",Memphis and its Necropolis,https://egymonuments.gov.eg/media/3124/international-campaign17.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=645&height=423&rnd=132221976670000000,,world place
