The sea port consists of the remains of water installations in the form of the Latin letter L with a slightly spherical angle. Today, part of it appears on a small rocky head, then extends eastward to about 160 m and then extends irregularly to the south-east for about 130 m. The width of this building is between 8 m and 14 m and is deposited in water that does not exceed the depth - currently - two meters. It is likely that this building was constructed to serve as a barrier to the northern waves and currents to provide a large water area where ships can dock and depart safely. The water area occupied by the inland basin of the old port is estimated to be at least 5.67 ha. The site's function as a seaport is confirmed by the finding of 21 limestone anchors dating back to the 4th Dynasty, about 120 meters from the present beach and about 11 meters south of the wave barrier. There is no doubt that the discovery of the port, which dates back to the era of King Khufu, the most famous of the kings of the fourth family (about 2600 BC) in the location of the valley of the shelf is one of the most important scientific events in the modern era; because it contains the oldest facilities of the port known industrial so far in the world, This port is that the ancient Egyptians had experienced the establishment of sea ports since the fourth family at least, and formed a network between the Red Sea coast and the Sinai Peninsula.

The bay was the gateway to the ships coming from the Mediterranean on their way to the Nile. By hugging the coast of the bay, the ships traveled to the Canopic branch of the Nile and transported their goods to all of Egypt.
Pottery sherds and amphorae were found scattered on the bay?s seabed, a testament to the many shipwrecks that took place here. The artifacts testify to the flourishing trade between Egypt and the world. A survey of the seabed revealed an ancient Roman shipwreck, remains of which are still present today.
Little is known about Mamoura Bay, but excavations are gradually providing us with information on the area. A small port and paving dating to the Greco-Roman Period were found, along with the limestone quarry that was used to build them.

This area in the sea is difficult to navigate due to its shallow waters and multitude of corals, which is probably the reason the ship sank in the 1760?s. The ship was 50 meters long and was carrying about 900 tons of cargo. Excavations revealed that the ship was carrying Chinese Qing Dynasty porcelain that was fashioned for the Middle East. Many spices were also found aboard the ship including pepper, cardamom and nutmeg from India; frankincense from Oman; as well as, coconuts, olives and hazelnuts among other things. The ship does not resemble other ships from this period, and so its origin remains unknown.

The eastern harbor was the royal port of Alexandria and once had palaces, temples and the legendary Pharos Lighthouse, one of the Seven Wonders of the World. Today, the remains of the city have been submerged under the Mediterranean Sea. The most prominent monument from the harbor was the Pharos Lighthouse that was commissioned by Ptolemy I Soter I in 297 B.C, and that was a landmark in the ancient city. The lighthouse stood 130 meters tall and had a beacon that guided ships to the port from up to 50 kilometers at sea. The beacon consisted of a fire that was reflected off of a massive bronze mirror. The lighthouse deteriorated with time and after an earthquake in the 14th Century, it collapsed.
Recent excavations at the harbor discovered a marble floor believed to be part of Cleopatra?s palace. A temple to Isis, sphinxes and statues were also found at the harbor submerged on the seabed.

These two cities already existed before the founding of Alexandria in 332 BC by Alexander the Great. Canopus and Herakleion were extremely prosperous, deriving their wealth from trade and the taxation of goods brought to their ports for transport on the Nile. They were the gateways into ancient Egypt. A dynasty of Macedonians was founded by Ptolemy I Soter (305?285 BC) after the death of Alexander. This line of kings wished to develop Egypt?s new capital. Trade was thus diverted to Alexandria, as well as a lot of wealth taken from the priests and merchants of Canopus and Herakleion. These cities were very significant religious centers as well, and they retained this importance even after Alexandria overtook them as the center for trade. Canopus and Herakleion were eventually submerged into the Mediterranean. This was the result of a number of factors. The type of soil and its vicinity to the Mediterranean led to subsidence of the land, meaning that the water?saturated soil began to compact and collapse over time. A series of earthquakes starting Late Antiquity led to even more destruction, and even more land ended up underwater. The effects of the earthquakes were exacerbated by the existing fragility of the soil. The rise in sea level over the course of the past two millennia submerged what remained of the cities. Thanks to underwater archaeology, Thonis and Herakleion, which were until only recently remembered only through textual sources, have been rediscovered. Much of the layout of these two cities is well known, with more discoveries on the way. Many artefacts and monuments are being brought out from the depths, including colossal statues, steles, and a variety of religious and daily?life objects, shedding light on the lives that once populated these two great cities.",the west of Alexandria,"[https://egymonuments.gov.eg/media/1038/%D9%87%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%83%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86.jpg , https://egymonuments.gov.eg/media/1039/%D8%B9%D9%85%D9%84%D8%A9.jpg ,  https://egymonuments.gov.eg/media/1488/01_2.jpg , https://egymonuments.gov.eg/media/1491/12_1.jpg , https://egymonuments.gov.eg/media/1702/04.jpg , https://egymonuments.gov.eg/media/1724/2.jpg , https://egymonuments.gov.eg/media/1725/%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%AB%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%89-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AB%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%AC%D8%AD-%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%89-%D9%88%D8%B9%D8%AB%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A3%D8%A8%D9%89-%D9%82%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%88%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%85%D9%83%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1-%D9%88%D9%85%D9%86%D9%82%D8%B3%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%B9%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%A1.jpg , https://egymonuments.gov.eg/media/1726/%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%88%D8%B3-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%B1-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%AC%D8%B9-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%89-%D9%88%D8%AA%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%AB%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87-%D8%A8%D8%A3%D8%A8%D9%89-%D9%82%D9%8A%D8%B1.jpg , https://egymonuments.gov.eg/media/1728/%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AD%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%AC%D8%B9-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AB%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AB%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%81%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%84-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%85-%D9%86%D9%82%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%A8%D9%88-%D9%88%D8%AA%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%AB%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D8%A3%D8%A8%D9%89-%D9%82%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%88%D9%85%D8%B5%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B9%D9%87-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%AD%D8%AC%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AA.jpg , https://egymonuments.gov.eg/media/1729/6.jpg , https://egymonuments.gov.eg/media/1731/8.jpg , https://egymonuments.gov.eg/media/1732/9.jpg , https://egymonuments.gov.eg/media/1735/%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%AB%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%84%D9%85%D9%84%D9%83%D8%A9-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%89-%D9%85%D8%B5%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AA-%D9%88%D8%AA%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%AB%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D8%A3%D8%A8%D9%89-%D9%82%D9%8A%D8%B1.jpg , https://egymonuments.gov.eg/media/1738/15.jpg , https://egymonuments.gov.eg/media/1876/%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%AB%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%84%D9%85%D9%84%D9%83-%D9%8A%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%85%D9%84-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%89-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%B1-%D9%88%D8%AA%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%AB%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87-%D8%A8%D8%A3%D8%A8%D9%89-%D9%82%D9%8A%D8%B1.jpg , https://egymonuments.gov.eg/media/1877/%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%AB%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%84%D9%85%D9%84%D9%83%D8%A9-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%89-%D9%85%D8%B5%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B9-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AA-%D9%88%D8%AA%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%AB%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87-%D8%A8%D8%A3%D8%A8%D9%89-%D9%82%D9%8A%D8%B1.jpg ,]",,,

Massive stones were transported on ships from quarries in the south intended for tombs, temples and other monuments in the north. Aswan had two quarries that were extensively used: granite was brought from Aswan, and sandstone from Gebel El Silsila.
The journey undertaken by the ships carrying such heavy loads was not always successful, and some sunk in the Nile. In addition, some massive stones fell during their transfer onto the ships and now lie in the river?s depths. A quay for the transport of the heavy stones has been identified at Elephantine, called El -Ahly Quay, and is believed to have been one of the primary quays used. A smaller quay was also found at El Naga El Bahari.",El Naga El Bahari.,"[https://egymonuments.gov.eg/media/1025/4.jpg , https://egymonuments.gov.eg/media/1622/2.jpg , https://egymonuments.gov.eg/media/1028/1.jpg , https://egymonuments.gov.eg/media/1623/3.jpg , https://egymonuments.gov.eg/media/1625/5.jpg , https://egymonuments.gov.eg/media/1626/6.jpg , https://egymonuments.gov.eg/media/1026/41-copy.jpg , ",,,
