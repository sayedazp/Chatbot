Strictly speaking, “prehistory” refers to the phase of a culture before it had writing. In Egypt’s case, writing appears at around the same time as the end of its Stone Age, around 3100 BC. This is also when Egypt as a unified political entity came into being, making it the world’s oldest nation state.            Before the formation of the first Egyptian state, during the Neolithic Period, an increasing homogenization of the different cultures that had emerged along the Nile Valley can be seen. Cultures are named after their sites of origin. Some of the most important of these are the Maadi Cultural Complex (c.4000–3100 BC) in Lower Egypt, near Cairo; Badarian culture (c.5500–4000 BC) near modern Asyut in Middle Egypt; and, most importantly Naqada I (c.4000–3500 BC) in Upper Egypt, near Luxor.            Naqada I culture, like its contemporaries, initially displays little in the way of social stratification, but this changes towards the end of this period. This trend became more pronounced during Naqada II (c.3500–3200 BC), which began to spread along the Nile Valley. Among the most important Naqada II sites, aside from Naqada itself, were Hierakonpolis (Kom al‑Ahmar), near Edfu, and Abydos, both in Upper Egypt. During Naqada III (c.3500–3100 BC), society continued to grow more complex, and differentiated itself from contemporary Nubian culture, eventually separating itself from it politically. The transition from Naqada III to the Early Dynastic Period was a smooth one. For this reason, Naqada III is sometimes also called “Dynasty 0”.          The powerful chiefs of this final period appear to have already been in control of most, if not all, of Egypt. Upper and Lower Egypt were geographically different, and the two had remained distinct until late in prehistory, and the ancient Egyptians never forgot this fact. Thus, when Egypt eventually became united as one political entity under a single ruler, the ancient Egyptians, throughout their entire history, referred to their king as the “Lord of the Two Lands”.

The Early Dynastic Period begins with the unification of Egypt into a single political entity around 3100 BC, and consists of the very first two dynasties.          The unification of Upper and Lower Egypt was in reality a very gradual process, but one of its final stages appears to have taken place during the reign of King Narmer. One of the most important treasures in the Egyptian Museum, Cairo, the Narmer Palette, is a record of his historic event. With the unification of Egypt, a new capital was founded: Memphis. Then known as Ineb‑Hedj “The White Wall”, this new city, situated between—and thus uniting—Upper and Lower Egypt, would remain one the country’s most important and populous cities throughout ancient Egyptian history.            The area of Abydos (near modern Sohag) retained its prominence from the preceding Naqada III period. The kings of the First Dynasty were buried here, and their tombs demonstrate a tremendous leap forward in monumentality. Egypt was becoming more centralized, and the king’s power was growing.          Most of the Second Dynasty rulers were buried in Memphis, but the last two, Kings Peribsen and Khasekhemwy, had their final resting places constructed in Abydos. Tantalizing clues suggest a power struggle between them. This may have been echoed in the stories revolving around the gods Horus and Seth, but this is far from certain. Royal power grew demonstrably during the reign of Khasekhemwy. Like his predecessors, he paired his tomb with a funerary enclosure closer to the Nile Valley. This truly massive structure, today known as the Shunet al‑Zebib, far surpassed any of those of his predecessors, however, and remains one of the world’s oldest surviving brick structures."

The king’s power continued to grow during this period. The early-Third Dynasty King Djoser built an even grander tomb, this time back in Saqqara. He intended to built a mastaba tomb like the kings of the First and Second Dynasties. This was gradually expanded, and five successive mastabas were built on top of one another, resulting in Egypt’s first pyramid and oldest fully stone structure, the Step Pyramid. The attempted step pyramids of the other kings of the Third Dynasty were never completed, presumably due to a succession of short reigns.

          Little is known of the first ruler of the Fourth Dynasty, Huni. The reign of the second king, Snefru (c.2613–2589 BC), was immensely prosperous and successful. Three massive pyramids were built during his reign alone. The first, in Meidum, was begun as a Step Pyramid, and later completed as a true pyramid. The second, the so-called Bent Pyramid in Dahshur, was the first pyramid to have been intended as a true pyramid, but structural flaws meant that this could not be achieved. With his third pyramid, the Red Pyramid, also in Dahshur, Egypt’s first true pyramid was completed, paving the way for the building of the perfect pyramid.

          This was achieved in the immediately succeeding reign of King Khufu (c.2589–2566 BC), who built the largest and most ambitious pyramid and pyramid complex. The Great Pyramid, with its original height of 146.5 meters, was the tallest structure in the world for 3,800 years. Khufu’s brother and successor, Djedefre (c.2566–2558 BC), did not finish his pyramid. He was succeeded by Khufu’s son, Khafre (c.2558–2532 BC), who constructed the Great Sphinx, and a pyramid very nearly as large as his father’s. The two temples associated with his pyramid were larger and more elaborate than those of his predecessors.

          The pyramid of Khafre’s son, Menkaure (c.2532–2503 BC), is considered to mark the beginning of a downward trend in royal power. Although his pyramid is indeed substantially smaller, at least a quarter of its height was encased in granite, a much harder stone that is obtained from Aswan, Egypt’s southern border. Furthermore, the temples adjacent to his temple are proportionally larger than those of his predecessors, suggesting a shift in the king’s priorities, from his tomb to his cult that would be practiced in these temples.

          This trend grew more pronounced in the Fifth (c.2494–2487 BC) and Sixth (c.2345–2181 BC) Dynasties. The last king of the Fifth Dynasty, Unas, had the interior of his pyramid in Saqqara decorated with the Pyramid Texts, the precursors to the more famous so-called Book of the Dead. The purpose of these texts was to help the king successfully reach the afterlife and achieve godhood.

          By the Sixth Dynasty, it is clear that the king’s power had decreased. This, in combination with a range of other factors, meant that, by the end of the long reign of its final king, Pepy II (c.2278–2184 BC), the central government was no longer in firm control of the entirety of Egypt."

These local administrators eventually became completely independent from Memphis and, seeking to extend their respective territories, came to establish their own forces. This resulted in civil wars and the deterioration of political and economic conditions. It is believed that it was during this period of turmoil that the royal pyramid complexes were robbed.

          The written sources from the following period, the Middle Kingdom (c.2055–1650 BC), describe the First Intermediate Period as a time of famine and chaos. The absence of the king and central government supposedly led to poverty, the loss of moral values, and instability. Archaeological evidence, however, paints a very different picture. New forms and shapes of pottery were invented, new, architectural forms specific to individual provinces found expression, and local popular culture flourished. Life seems to have simply continued. If anything, the economy of the provinces and of the average person in these areas, free from the demands of the central administration, appears to have improved. Local rulers became paternal figures who took care of their people, boasting about how they fed the hungry and gave water to the thirsty. The notion of the ruler as benefactor would have deep repercussions on the conception of kingship in the following period.

          Another one of the most important developments of this period is the so-called “democratization of the afterlife”. This is when the Coffin Texts first appeared. As their name suggests, these were usually written on the insides of coffins. Their purpose, to ensure that the deceased successfully reached the afterlife, is the same as the Pyramid Texts, from which they evolved. Unlike them, however, the Coffin Texts were not exclusive to royalty. Private, non‑royal, individuals now had a chance to an afterlife, independently of their king. Whether this was the case earlier too is hotly debated, as is whether people had already access to funerary texts, but it is clear that it was never this overt.

          Eventually, the Ninth and Tenth Dynasties, which were based in Herakleopolis (modern Ihnasya al‑Medina), came to rule Egypt, but they held a tenuous grasp over their territories, especially the south. A new dynasty arose in Thebes (modern Luxor) in Upper Egypt that was powerful enough to challenge them. The First Intermediate Period ended with the reunification of Egypt by King Nebhepetre Mentuhotep of the victorious Theban Eleventh Dynasty, ushering into the prosperous Middle Kingdom period."

It consists of the Eleventh to Thirteenth Dynasties. Although the Eleventh Dynasty had its origins in the First Intermediate Period, it is a later king in this same royal family who reunified Egypt, thus initiating the Middle Kingdom. This king was Nebhepetre Mentuhotep (c.2055–2004 BC). The Eleventh Dynasty came from Thebes (modern Luxor) which, although hitherto an unimportant city, would become one of the most prominent throughout the rest of ancient Egyptian history. One of the main gods of Thebes, Amun, had similarly had a minor role in ancient Egyptian religion, but he quickly rose to prominence in step with his city, eventually gaining the adjective “King of the Gods”. The oldest evidence for his main place of worship, Karnak Temple, dates to the Middle Kingdom, and it would become the largest and wealthiest ancient Egyptian religious establishment by the end of the New Kingdom.          Due to his Theban origins, Nebhepetre Mentuhotep was buried across the Nile from Thebes, on the west bank, in Deir al-Bahari. His monument was, in addition to being a tomb, also the temple for his mortuary cult. Partially cut into the cliff face and partially a free-standing structure, with its terrace set on a raised platform that is accessed by a central rising ramp, it is clear that this structure served as a partial inspiration for its more famous neighbor, the temple of Hatshepsut, which lies immediately to its left.          Massive agricultural projects were undertaken during this time as well, particularly in the Fayum region in Middle Egypt. Canals were dug, a part of the lake drained, and the resulting lands reclaimed for agriculture. The kings of the Twelfth Dynasty were buried in this area, in monumental pyramids near the new capital that was founded by Amenemhat I, Itj‑Tawy, the precise location of which is still unknown.          The Middle Kingdom was a cultural highpoint in ancient Egyptian history, but most worthy of mention of all are its contributions to ancient Egyptian language and literature. May new genres were invented, and many new literary compositions were written, many of which would remain popular for over a thousand years. The language used to write these texts, with its grammatical rules, is called Middle Egyptian, which would serve as the language of official texts carved down to the Ptolemaic (332–30 BC) and Roman Periods (30 BC–395 AD)."
Second Intermediate Period,"1650 BC

Most settled in the north-eastern Delta. A contemporary text names one of their leaders Heqa khasut “the ruler of foreign lands”. This word is more familiar to us today in its Hellenized (Greek) form, Hyksos. It is unknown how they came to power, but the weaker Thirteenth Dynasty was unable to prevent this from happening, and they moved their capital from Itj-Tawy in the north to Thebes (modern Luxor) in Upper Egypt, away from the sphere of influence of the Hyksos.

          Thus began the Second Intermediate Period. The Hyksos Fifteenth Dynasty, based in Avaris (modern Tell al-Dab’a) in the north-eastern Delta, controlled most of the country in the north, down to al-Qusiya (ancient Qis, Greek Kusai or Cusae) in Middle Egypt, including even Memphis. The Nubian Kerma culture, on the rise, controlled the south. Between them and the Hyksos, a line of local kings in Upper Egypt, centered around Thebes, remained. An obscure Fourteenth Dynasty, based in Khois (modern Sakha, near Kafr al-Sheikh) in the central Delta, appears to have co-existed with the Hyksos, at least at first, before being absorbed by them. Another, short-lived, dynasty, also appears to have been based in Abydos.

          Ancient Egyptian culture thrived under the Hyksos, as did their own, native, West Semitic culture of the Bronze Age Levant. Many aspects of this culture are apparent in Avaris, such as the style of pottery and weaponry, house layout, and burial customs. Their tombs, for example, were located within living areas, rather than in a cemetery outside of the city.

          It is not known what marked the transition from the Thirteenth Dynasty, which had moved from Itj-Tawy to Thebes, to the Sixteenth, which itself then transitioned to the Seventeenth. Both of these dynasties were quite militaristic, however, and their power grew over time. The later Seventeenth Dynasty kings were wealthy, experienced, and powerful enough to wage war against the Hyksos. Kings Seqenenre Taa and Kamose, most likely his son, made great progress. The former appears to have died as a result of his campaigning. Ahmose, captured formerly Hyksos territories, managed to sack Avaris, and expulsed the Hyksos. He then made conquests in southern Palestine, and south in Nubia.

          These events mark the beginning of the Eighteenth Dynasty and beginning of the New Kingdom, Egypt’s age of empire. The Second Intermediate Period had long-lasting effects on Egyptian history. New technologies were introduced into Egypt, such as Near Eastern musical instruments and board games, an improved potter’s wheel, new crops, and new military technology, most importantly composite bows and the horse and chariot. The Hyksos’ control of most of Egypt left an indelible mark on the psyche of the ancient Egyptians: Foreign conquest was a very real threat, and border fortresses alone were insufficient to safeguard Egypt’s borders. The kings of the New Kingdom would pursue an aggressive expansionist policy."

Its southern borders reached the Fourth Cataract in Nubia, and to modern-day Syria in the north. The economy flourished to an astounding degree, and most of the most famous and impressive surviving ancient Egyptian monuments date to this period.           The Eighteenth Dynasty (c.1550–1295 BC) began with Ahmose II, who expelled the Hyksos, a West Semitic people who ruled most of Egypt during the preceding period. Most of the kings of the early New Kingdom pursued an aggressive foreign policy in response. The acquired wealth was used to undertake many construction projects everywhere in Egypt, particularly in Karnak Temple in Luxor, the temple of the most important god of Thebes, Amun. Most of the kings of this dynasty were buried in the now-famous Valley of the Kings.           Thutmose III proved to be a most capable ruler. During his reign, Egypt’s borders reached their furthest extent. His monuments span the length of the Nile Valley, including Nubia, and he left as big a mark on Karnak Temple as Hatshepsut did. Peace was eventually achieved during the reign of his son, Amenhotep II. Peace and international trade bore their fruit during the reign of Amenhotep III in particular. Few kings can match the quality, scale, and quantity of his construction projects. He built many monuments across Egypt and Nubia, including half of Luxor Temple as it survives today.           His son, Amenhotep IV, changed his name to Akhenaten, and proclaimed that there was only one god: Aten, which was also the ancient Egyptian word for the sun-disk in the sky. His reign saw other revolutionary changes in royal ideology, art, architecture, and language. He neglected Egypt’s foreign affairs, however, and by the end of his reign, Egypt’s territories in the Levant (the area of Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria) were lost."

By the end of his reign, Ramesses XI (c.1099–1069 BC), the last king of the New Kingdom, was no longer in effective rule of the whole of Egypt. After his death, a branch of the Ramesside family ruled from Tanis (modern San al-Hagar) in the north-eastern Delta. Although the reign of this line of kings, the Twenty-First (c.1069–945 BC), was acknowledged throughout the country, Upper Egypt was in reality governing itself, headed by the powerful high-priest of the god Amun in Luxor, who simultaneously held the highest military office as well. Historians describe this period as a theocracy, since it was the god Amun who held the highest authority.          Sheshonq I, the founder of the Twenty-Second Dynasty (c.945–715 BC), came from a powerful Libyan family from Bubastis (modern Tell Basta) in the eastern Delta, which he made his capital. He managed to bring the country under his control, successfully campaigned in the Levant (the area of Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria), and undertook monumental construction projects. This short-term success could not reverse the overall trend of decentralization in Egypt and, after his death, the central government’s control over the country continued to slip.          Simultaneously in the Near East, the Neo-Assyrian Empire had become a world power. It had expanded as far as Palestine, and a clash with Egypt became inevitable. Although he Kushite kings successfully defended Egypt, the Assyrians were ultimately victorious. The Kushites managed to reconquer Egypt as far as the Delta, but the Assyrians, headed by the great king Assurbanipal, retaliated, and sacked Thebes."

The Nubians killed their king, Bakenrenef (Bocchoris to the Greeks). After the Assyrians conquered Egypt and the Kushite king Tanutamani retreated to Nubia, King Assurbanipal installed the Saite kings to rule Egypt on his behalf.          Once the Assyrians’ grip on Egypt loosened, the Saite king Psamtik I (664–610 BC), began to consolidate his power throughout the country. Thus began the Twenty-sixth Dynasty and Late Period, when Egypt was once again a major world power. Trade flourished, and trading ports on and near the Mediterranean enriched the coffers of the nation. Greek merchants and artisans played a particularly important role in this regard. With a strong economy, monumental construction projects resumed all along the Nile Valley. Some of the most beautiful ancient Egyptian art was produced in this period. The kings of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty looked to Egypt’s already very ancient past, the Old Kingdom (c.2686–2181 BC) in particular, for inspiration. The result were objects that were influenced by old traditions, and that were yet very new. The reign of King Ahmose III (better known as Amasis; 570–526 BC) was particularly prosperous.          The Neo-Babylonian Empire was defeated by the rising Achaemenid Persian Empire under the leadership of King Cyrus the Great (559–530 BC). The Saite kings contended with this new threat, but Psamtik III (526–525 BC) was defeated by the Persian king Cambyses. The Twenty-seventh Dynasty consists of the Persian rulers. Although this was a prosperous period, the Egyptians wanted independence, and revolted when they could.           In this, King Amunirdis (Amyrtaios to the Greeks; 404–399 BC) of Sais was successful. He ruled the whole country, founding the Twenty-eighth Dynasty. He was the only ruler in this line, however, as his throne was usurped by Nepherites I (399–393 BC), who founded the Twenty-ninth Dynasty. This new line successfully defended Egypt against the Persians, but the throne was usurped from them as well, this time by their general Nekhtnebef."
