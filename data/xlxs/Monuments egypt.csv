Rock Inscriptions of Sehel Island,"https://egymonuments.gov.eg/media/7854/img_20211213_143705.jpg?crop=0.19818298199546813,0,0.08260458334355876,0&cropmode=percentage&width=645&height=423&rnd=132942370220000000","Sehel Island is one of the largest islands on the Nile, located upstream from the First Cataract in Aswan region, and contained a gold-mine and a quarry for the mining of granite, the hardest stone used in ancient Egypt. The island became a popular resting-spot for the king’s army and trading expeditions making their way upstream into Nubia. As a result, the island contains hundreds of inscriptions and royal cartouches, immortalising countless officials and kings. Many of these inscriptions can be seen on the large granite boulders surrounding the island. There are also many within the boundaries of the temple of the goddess Anuket, who was part of the Elephantine triad, along with her parents Khnum and Satet.

Continual use of this island can be seen from its oldest inscriptions dating to the Middle Kingdom (c. 2034–1650 BC), through until the Graeco-Roman Period when the famous “Famine Stela” was carved in to the natural granite rock. One inscription from the time of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III (c. 1479–1425 BC) records that the Overseer of Construction Works managed the feat of extracting six obelisks from the granite quarries of Aswan.

The Famine Stela

The fascinating text of this stela carved on the face of a granite boulder on Sehel Island tells the story of a nation in crisis, its concerned king, and his efforts to find a solution. Although it was composed and carved in the Ptolemaic Period (332–30 BC), the events are set around 2500 years earlier.

The Famine Stela is inscribed in 32 vertical rows of hieroglyphic script, with a scene above it depicting King Djoser (c. 2686–2667 BC) presenting offerings to the divine triad of Elephantine consisting of the god Khnum, his wife Satet and their daughter Anuket. The country is gripped in seven years of drought and famine and King Djoser summons his famous courtier, the wise Imhotep to find a solution. Imhotep told the king that the inundation came from the sacred spring in Elephantine Island, whose god Khnum was the one who controlled the flow of water. Djoser dutifully made offerings to the gods of Elephantine and Khnum appeared to him in a dream one night, promising him to end the famine by returning the flood. To celebrate the return of prosperity, Djoser built a temple on Elephantine to thank Khnum.    ",Aswan,24 hours daily,free

Situated on the western bank of the Nile, its construction began during the reign of Ptolemy III in 237 BC, but was completed in the reign of Ptolemy XII in 57 BC, 180 years later. The temple remained buried under layers of settlement debris for millennia, which is why its architectural and decorative elements have survived so well. In 1860 the French archaeologist Auguste Mariette uncovered and restored parts of the temple. The temple is fronted by two massive pylons that bear scenes of Ptolemy XII conquering his enemies and worshipping deities. Two large granite statues of the falcon-god Horus stand before the pylons. Once through the pylons you enter into a large Peristyle court lined with columns decorated with floral capitals. Beyond this court are two Hypostyle Halls, the first illustrates the temple’s foundation with the king engaged in worship, the second holds scenes of Horus’ journey in a sacred bark accompanied by the goddess Hathor. From the second Hypostyle Hall is the Transverse Hall, then the Sanctuary of the temple.    ","

Khnumhotep’s life is recorded in 222 columns of text which run across the lower section of the chapel walls. On either side of the statue shrine, painted scenes also show him fishing and fowling in the marshes. The most famous scene in this tomb, however, is on the north wall, to the left of the entrance: a delegation of 37 ‘Amu (people who lived to the east and north-east of Egypt) consisting of men, women, and children dressed in beautiful, colorful clothing bringing eye-paint to Khnumhotep. The head of the delegation has his own caption, which gives us his name, Absha, and which describes him as a heqa khaset – ruler of a foreign land. This is the oldest known example of the word that is far better known today in its Greek form, Hyksos. On the west wall, on your left directly after entering the tomb chapel, you will notice a fascinating scene depicting three monkeys helping fruit gatherers collect figs from the tree! ","

It consists of a forecourt leading to the tomb which gives access to the chapel. There, a small shrine was added in the south-eastern corner (at the far end, on the right), with a false door carved on its west wall and an offering platform in front of it. The walls of the tomb, like those of others tombs at Beni Hasan, have a decorative frieze at the top, which the ancient Egyptians called a kheker. As is standard for tombs in the upper cemetery at Beni Hasan, the north wall (the one left of the entrance) depicts scenes of hunting in the desert. This same wall, as in the tomb of Khety, depicts scenes of everyday life: here, barbers, sandal makers, goldsmiths, spinners, and weavers can all be seen, in addition to a scene showing tax collection, in which defaulters are being brought by force before a scribe. Also interesting is the lowest register which, alongside fishing, depicts different species of fish and flying creatures, mostly birds, but bats, too. More animals can be seen on the south wall, where a cat is facing a mouse, and below them, accompanied by a male monkey, a female monkey is carrying a young monkey on her back. Two baboons can also be seen next to the monkeys. The east wall of the tomb depicts a battle and a besieged fortress, and 220 pairs of wrestlers. In each pair, one wrestler is painted red and the other dark brown, so that the interaction between the two men can be seen clearly.   ","

His tomb dates to (c.2055–1956 BC) in the Middle Kingdom. It consists of a forecourt leading to the entrance and a room which originally had two rows of three columns with lotus capitals. Only one column in each row survives intact today. The walls of this tomb bear many interesting painted scenes. Upon entering the tomb, one is immediately struck by the wrestling scenes on the east wall, wrestlers are seen in various positions and in military trainings in preparation to storm castles and fortresses. Facing the entrance: 122 pairs of wrestlers in five registers (sections) are locked in combat, no two in the same position. Below them, the beleaguered defenders of a fortress are fighting off their attackers. The north wall (to the left of the entrance) depicts, as is usual for the tombs in the upper cemetery at Beni Hasan, scenes of wild animal hunting in the desert. In the registers below these, depictions of barbers, carpentry, a scene of a statue being sculpted of the deceased and his wife alongside scenes of funeral rituals, and spinning and weaving can all be seen, in addition to scenes of men playing board games, and young women juggling and performing acrobatics. All of these activities are presided over by Khety and his wife, who can be seen further down this wall. The south wall also depicts the wine making process, and scenes of listening to music and performing different sports.   ","

It didn’t use to be this colour, but a beautiful pure white of limestone of Tura, south of modern Cairo. All pyramids had a casing made of this white limestone, which was reused in medieval times. It is the third-largest Egyptian pyramid after those of Khufu and Khafra at Giza. The Red Pyramid was one of three pyramids built by King Sneferu after the Bent Pyramid, located one kilometre to the south, and the so-called Meidum pyramid. This pyramid may have been started in the 13th year of his reign, taking 10 years to be built. The visitor can enter the pyramid from an entrance on the northern side, leading to a passageway (a meter in height and a meter in width). It then slopes down to another gallery into a chamber with a corbelled roof, similar to an inverted stairway. Another passage leads to a second chamber located in the middle of the pyramid, directly at the western end of that chamber. To the south of it, a passageway leads to a third chamber, which is believed to have been the pyramid’s burial chamber.  ","

It was called “bent” because of its broken lines due to a change of angle, an engineering issue in its design. Indeed, the pyramid construction began at an angle of 55 degrees but had to be adjusted to 43 degrees due to an overload in stones resulting in instability. Despite their adjustments, the King’s designers made a new pyramid at a short distance, in Meidum, the Red Pyramid. The first angle of the Bent Pyramid suggests the transition phase between the Step-pyramid design of King Djoser in Saqqara and the later smooth-faced pyramids. The Bent Pyramid has two entrances, one on the north side, with modern wooden stairs, and the other is high on the west side. Each entrance leads to a chamber with a corbelled roof, giving this gradual effect. The northern entrance chamber is below ground level. As for the western entrance chamber, it is built higher up in the body of the Bent Pyramid.   ","

This magnificent complex is the oldest stone building of the ancient world. Basically, it was named the “Southern Tomb” following its discovery by the English archaeologist Cecil Malaby Firth in 1928. Significantly, the tomb is composed of an upper level in the form of a rectangular stone building. Its walls are decorated with a series of stone sockets in the form of entrances and exits, crowned by a frieze of cobra heads that symbolize protection and power. Regarding the lower level of the tomb represents an entrance towards a ramp leading to the burial chamber, which is located at the bottom of a great shaft measuring 7.5 x 7.5 m, and with a depth of approximately 31 m, including a huge sarcophagus made of 16 blocks of pink granite, each measuring approximately 3.60 metres high, 3.5 metres wide, and 3.6 metres long.  Furthermore, one can note the similarity between the well and the sarcophagus with those inside the step pyramid. One of the most important architectural and decorative elements of the Southern Tomb are a series of corridors, one of which contains three false doors, each topped with exquisite reliefs depicting the king taking part in the Heb-Sed Festival. This was a vital event, a royal jubilee, with the aim to rejuvenate the king and renew his right to rule. One can admire the king here being represented wearing the royal beard, as well as the White Crown of Upper Egypt, and several walls of the southern tomb’s corridors are decorated with the same blue faience tiles into the step pyramid. Various theories have been proposed about this tomb, as it is believed that it belonged to the royal wife of the king, or that it was built in order to house the internal organs of the king (lungs, stomach, intestines and liver).","

Originally, Bastet was depicted as a lioness, and later as a cat.
According to the Greek historian ""Herodotus"" who visited “Per Bastet” in the 5th century BC, that despite other temples being more grandiose in appearance, none was more beautiful than the temple of ""Bastet"". This temple would have been surrounded by two channels and lined with trees, thus allowing a wonderful view of the city.
During the 22nd Dynasty, when Per Bastet became the capital of Egypt, the temple of Bastet was extended, and as a result, a lot of material from earlier structures was re-used. The oldest of these are two red granite blocks dating to the reign of the 4th Dynasty king Khufu (c.2589–2566 BC) and king Khafre (c.2558–2532 BC).
Additions to this temple were continued by the second king of the 22nd Dynasty, Osorkon I (c.924–889 BC), with his name appearing frequently at the entrance of the temple. The site contained a monumental gate beyond the peristyle courtyard. This was built by Osorkon II, and decorated with scenes of him celebrating the Heb Sed Festival.
In the far west, there is a long colonnade that leads to a hypostyle hall, also built by Osorkon II, and which contains papyrus and Hathor columns. The far west end of the temple, which comprised the Holy of Holies in the complex (the sanctuary), was renewed by the last Egyptian king of the 30th and final Dynasty, King Nectanebo II (360–343 BC).     ","

Her mother was the famous Queen Nefertari, and after her death, she also became a Great Royal Wife of Ramesses II.
This colossal pink granite statue weighs an astonishing 80 tons and stands at 9 meters in height. It was discovered by the joint mission of the Supreme Council of Antiquities and the University of Potsdam, Germany in 2001.
Although this statue was built during the reign of Ramesses II, it was later reinscribed by the 22nd Dynasty King Osorkon II (c.874–838 BC) for his wife Karomama, both of whose names can be seen on the back of this statue.

It was believed that the palace was the residence of king Amenemhat III when he was in Per Bastet, or of the mayors of the city and the governors of the province, due to the sheer size of the palace, which ranges at around 16,000 square meters. One can also find a wonderful limestone door lintel discovered inside, which shows king Amenemhat III (c.1860–1815 BC) taking part in his Heb Sed Festival.

In addition, one can find archaeological remains from the monumental gateway of the temple of Bastet, which was built by the 22nd Dynasty king Osorkon II (c.874–850 BC). This structure was entirely covered with depictions of Osorkon II celebrating the Heb Sed Festival. Generally, this purely royal festival aimed to rejuvenate the king and renew his royal power.
At the site there are also a large amount of stone fragments bearing the names and epithets of kings. A sandstone block depicts a standard with human arms surmounted by the Ka-hieroglyph (in the shape of two upraised arms), and a king’s Horus Name was written inside. Although it was fragmentary, it contained the Horus Name of King Nectanebo II / Nekhthorhebyt (360–343 BC), the last king of the 30th and final Dynasty.
The open air museum also includes a group of statues of kings and deities. The most prominent is the red granite statue of the 19th Dynasty King Ramesses II (c.1279–1213 BC) standing between the goddess Hathor and the god Ptah. This in turn is found near a group of Graeco-Roman Period column capitals following the Corinthian style.

Part of the temple was built during the reigns of Ptolemy III and Ptolemy IV but was later on converted into a church, most likely to venerate Saint Mary. The temple is one of the most important archaeological discoveries due to the fact that it was found preserved in great conditions since its discovery in 1871. The temple remains standing tall with its four magnificent walls and roof with distinctive granite panels.           There are two entrances to the temple on the western side; where the main entrance is located in the middle of the facade and the other at the far left of the main entrance. Towards the back wall of the main hall of the temple, one can admire the wonderful scenes depicting the king making offerings to the gods (Satet - Anqet - Khnum) known as the Aswan trinity. During the restoration work of the mission, numerous Coptic inscriptions were revealed, as well as a rare architectural drawing illustrating the original layout of the temple on the walls. This can all be admired in addition to the remains of Roman and Islamic brick dwellings.           In the middle of the temple's façade is the majestic main gate, decorated with colorful scenes and texts, and above which one can find the winged sun disk featured in the middle. The entrance leads to a transverse hall containing three rooms in the middle of the hall of the Holy of Holies.            This section contains three imposing granite altars in the hall, two of which are located on the northern corridor of the main hall, whilst the other altar is situated on the southern corridor in addition to another one inside the Chamber of the Holy of Holies. All of these altars contain the titles of King Ptolemy IV inscribed on them. Some pictorial scenes are featured on the southern pillar of the hall representing a group of saints, thus confirming that the temple was used as a church in later periods. The Chamber of the Holy of Holies is located in the middle of the temple accessible through an entrance topped by the winged sun disk. In addition, it is decorated with a series of wonderful scenes, some of which illustrate beer being served to Isis, whilst other ones represent the goddess Maat being presented to the god Khnum, as well as another scene depicting pure water being poured on the goddess Isis","

It is located around three kilometers to the south of Karnak Temple, to which it was once linked with a processional way bordered with sphinxes. The oldest evidence for this temple dates to the Eighteenth Dynasty (c.1550–1295 BC).           Ipet‑resyt, unlike most other ancient Egyptian temples, is not laid out on an east‑west axis, but is oriented towards Karnak. This is because Luxor Temple was the main venue for one the most important of ancient Egyptian religious celebrations, when the cult images of Amun, his wife Mut, and their son, the lunar god Khonsu, were taken from their temples in Karnak, and transported in a grand procession to Luxor Temple so they could visit the god that resides there, Amenemopet. This was the Opet Festival.           Luxor Temple was not constructed by one single ruler. The oldest existing structure, a shrine, dates to the reign of Hatshepsut (c.1473–1458 BC). The core of the temple was built by Amenhotep III (c.1390–1352 BC). One of the inner rooms contains a series of scenes that are known as the Divine Birth. They tell the amazing story of how the king’s true father was none other than the god Amun himself. The core of the temple is preceded by a columned hall fronted by a courtyard with columns around its perimeter. Amenhotep III also built the Great Colonnade, which consists of two rows of seven colossal columns. Its decoration, most notably the scenes depicting the Opet Festival, were completed by Tutankhamun (c.1336–1327 BC) and Horemheb (c.1323–1295 BC).           Ramesses II (c.1279–1213 BC) made many additions to Luxor Temple. In front of the Great Colonnade, he built a peristyle courtyard and a massive pylon, a gate with two towers that formed the entrance into temples. In addition to many colossal statues, the pylon was also fronted by a pair of 25‑meter‑high obelisks made by this great king, but only one remains in place; the other has been at the Place de la Concorde in Paris since 1835–1836.           In the late third century AD, the Romans built a fort around the temple, and the first room beyond the hypostyle hall of Amenhotep III became its sanctuary. The original wall reliefs were covered with plaster, and painted in the Graeco‑Roman artistic style, depicting Emperor Diocletian (284–305 AD) and his three coregents. Although these had largely disappeared, efforts are under way to restore these to their former glory.","

It lies directly across the Nile from Karnak Temple, the main sanctuary of the god Amun. Hatshepsut’s temple, Djeser-djeseru “the Holy of Holies” was designed by the chief steward of Amun, Senenmut.           The temple consists of three levels each of which has a colonnade at its far end. On the uppermost level, an open courtyard lies just beyond the portico. Mummiform statues of Hatshepsut as Osiris, the god of the dead, lean against its pillars.           This is because Djeser-djeseru is Hatshepsut’s mortuary temple, where her cult was practiced after her death, when she attained the blessed state of Osiris. Far from being devoted solely to her, the temple also includes sections for the cults of her revered father Thutmose I, the goddess Hathor, and the funerary god Anubis. An altar, open to the sky and the sun, was dedicated to the cult of the solar Ra‑Horakhty. Pride of place was given to Amun. At the far end of the upper courtyard, on the temple’s central axis, a passage cut directly into the living rock culminates in his sanctuary.           The temple’s walls are covered with beautiful painted reliefs depicting temple rituals, religious festivals, and even the transportation of obelisks from the quarry to their destination in Karnak Temple. Perhaps most interesting are the reliefs in the portico on the so-called Middle Platform. The decorative programme on the left side depicts Hatshepsut’s expedition to Punt, believed to be located near modern Eritrea. The inhabitants of this land, their dwellings, and surrounding environment are vividly recorded, as are the riches and exotic animals that the Egyptians brought back with them. On the other side of the portico, Hatshepsut relates how she is the rightful king of Egypt. She does this not only by claiming that her father Thutmose I had designated her as his heir, but by stating that her true father was none other than the god Amun himself. ","

        Tomb of Tutankhamun
    ","https://egymonuments.gov.eg/media/3390/tutankhamun.jpg?center=0.44444444444444442,0.674074074074074&mode=crop&width=645&height=423&rnd=132898394070000000","The tomb of the Eighteenth Dynasty king Tutankhamun (c.1336–1327 BC) is world-famous because it is the only royal tomb from the Valley of the Kings that was discovered relatively intact. Its discovery in 1922 by Howard Carter made headlines worldwide, and continued to do so as the golden artifacts and other luxurious objects discovered in this tomb were being brought out. The tomb and its treasures are iconic of Egypt, and the discovery of the tomb is still considered one of the most important archaeological discoveries to date.          Despite the riches it contained, the tomb of Tutankhamun, number 62 in the Valley of the Kings, is in fact quite modest compared to the other tombs on this site, in both size and decoration. This is most likely due to Tutankhamun having come to the throne very young, and even then ruling for only around ten years in total. One can wonder at what riches the much larger tombs of the most powerful kings of the New Kingdom, such as Hatshepsut, Thutmose III, Amenhotep III, and Ramesses II once contained.           Only the walls of the burial chamber bear any decoration. Unlike most previous and later royal tombs, which are richly decorated with funerary texts like the Amduat or Book of Gates, which helped the deceased king reach the afterlife, only a single scene from the Amduat is represented in the tomb of Tutankhamun. The rest of decoration of the tomb depict either the funeral, or Tutankhamun in the company of various deities.           This small size of the tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62) has led to much speculation. When his successor, the high official Ay, died, he was buried in a tomb (KV23), which may have been originally intended for Tutankhamun, but which had not yet been completed at the time of the death of the young king. The same argument has been made in turn for the tomb of Ay’s successor, Horemheb (KV57). If so, it is unclear for whom the eventual tomb of Tutankhamun, KV62, was carved, but it has been argued that it existed already, either as a private tomb or as a storage area, that was subsequently enlarged to receive the king.          Whatever the reason, the small size of the tomb meant that the approximately 3,500 artefacts that were discovered inside were stacked very tightly. These reflect the lifestyle of the royal palace, and included objects that Tutankhamun would have used in his daily life, such as clothes, jewelry, cosmetics, incense, furniture, chairs, toys, vessels made of a variety of materials, chariots, and weapons.","

        Tomb of Sety I (KV17)

Sety I (c.1294–1279 BC) was the second king of the Nineteenth Dynasty, and father of Ramesses II (the Great). His tomb, number 17 in the Valley of the Kings, is sometimes called “Belzoni’s tomb” after its discoverer.           Like the other tombs in the Valley of the Kings, the tomb of Sety I is decorated with various funerary texts, the aim of which was to ensure his successful transition to the afterlife. The tomb of Sety I was the first tomb in the Valley of the Kings to be entirely decorated. The elegant painted scenes and reliefs are of the exquisite quality that the reign of Sety I is so well known for. The funerary texts attested there are the Litany of Re, Amduat, and Book of Gates, in addition to the Book of the Divine Cow and the gorgeous astronomical scenes decorating the ceiling of his burial chamber, simulating the night sky.           Architecturally, the tomb of Sety I falls under the “joggled axis” type characteristic of his period. The first series of corridors and descending passageways terminate into the first pillared room, where, in the facing wall, but off-axis, another series of descending passageways cut into the floor of the room lead to the burial chamber. The tomb does feature a number of new and unique characteristics. Along the same axis of the first series of corridors and descending passageways, a doorway leads into a single room. This may have been intended to lead intruders to believe that this was the actual burial chamber. The tomb of Sety I is also the first tomb to possess a burial chamber with a vaulted ceiling. Perhaps most interesting of all is the passage begins in the floor of the burial chamber, descending even further, deep into the earth. It is believed that this was intended to ritually connect the tomb of Sety I with the primeval and regenerative powers of the underworld.          In 1821, painted recreations of several rooms from the tomb of Sety I were displayed in the Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly in London. This exhibition, put together by the discoverer of the tomb, Giovanni Battista Belzoni, made an ancient Egyptian tomb available to various members of the public. It captured people’s imagination, and is one of the first monuments responsible for attracting popular attention to ancient Egypt. ","

Although it is uncertain whether he was ultimately buried here, it is clear that his uncle Ramesses VI (c.1143–1136 BC) enlarged the tomb and used it for his burial.           The tomb is simple in plan, essentially consisting of a series of descending corridors that lead deep underground, in a straight line to the burial chamber. The exquisitely painted sunk relief walls are very well preserved. A decline in the quality of the decoration since the Nineteenth Dynasty (c.1295–1186 BC) is evident, however.           The tomb’s decorative programme consists of various funerary texts to help the king in his successful transition to the afterlife. The first descending passages are decorated with the Book of Gates, Book of Caverns, and Books of the Heavens. The passages beyond bear scenes from the Amduat, the Book of the Dead, and the Books of the Heavens, and scenes from the Book of the Earth adorn the burial chamber. All ceilings are decorated with astronomical scenes and texts. Some of these funerary texts are collections of spells, and others are maps of the underworld, describing the sun god’s daily nocturnal journey through it. Through them, just like the sun god, the king could achieve a glorious rebirth in the eastern horizon at dawn.  ","

It is considered one of the most important monasteries established during Christianity’s early history. Because of the red bricks that make up most of its masonry, it is known as the Red Monastery. White limestone was employed in the building’s construction as well as were several pink and black granite columns. The monastery was founded by Saint Bishoy in the beginning of the fourth century AD, but suffered of two fires, the first was during the Roman Period, and the second was as a result of Berber attacks. All that remains of the Red Monastery is its church and surrounding fortification walls to the south. Remains of a structure north of the church also survived and are thought to belong to an industrial area. The main church is composed of a long rectangular space composed of three wings. The middle wing is the largest of the three. A church known as the “Church of the Virgin Mary” is attached to its south-west corner. On its eastern end, the monastery’s church terminates in a tripartite structure decorated with murals done with tempera paint depicting Biblical scenes that include Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, the Four Gospels, and the Apostles.
The fort occupies the area south of the church, to which its structures are attached. It likely dates to the reign of Empress Helena.
It is a roughly square building that consists of four floors, the ground and first floors of baked bricks, and the top two of simple sun-dried mud brick. The fort itself contains several units that allowed the monks to reside in it for long stretches of time, including a church, cells, a storage room, and a water source. ","

It is considered one of the most important places visited by the Holy Family during the Flight into Egypt, second only to the Muharraq Monastery. It was built in 328 AD by Empress Helena, the mother of Constantine the Great, the first Byzantine emperor to convert to Christianity.           Gabal al-Tayr gets its name from tayr “bird” from the vast number of birds living and nesting there. It is also known as Gabal al-Kaff “Mountain of the Palm (of the hand)” and Deir al-Bakara “The Monastery of the Pulley”.           The church is carved entirely out of the rock. It is probably a repurposed ancient Egyptian or Roman tomb. Decorative friezes incorporating flora, fauna, and human forms adorn the area above the western entrance. The church follows the early Christian basilical plan, consisting of a nave with two side aisles, a western return aisle, and three ambulatory shrines.           Gabal al-Tayr is one of the more important pilgrimage destinations.

With its original height of 146.5 meters, it was the tallest structure in the world for 3,800 years. The Great Pyramid still remains the last surviving member of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and took an estimated to 10 to 20 years to build. To this day, it is not entirely certain how this was done.             The Great Pyramid is made of local limestone, but its exterior was once entirely covered with high quality limestone. These casing stones were brought from Tura, south of Maadi, by ship. On the inside, the pyramid has three chambers, one cut into the bedrock underneath, and two high up within the masonry itself, a feature that no other pyramid possesses. The sarcophagus in which Khufu was once laid to rest can still be seen in the upper of these two rooms, the King’s Chamber. This room is accessed through the Grand Gallery, a majestic corbelled ascending passage, and a masterpiece of ancient engineering and architecture.             Two large and impressive ships were discovered in pits on the south side of the pyramid in a dismantled state. These are believed to have been used to transport the royal mummy and burial equipment to the tomb. The eastern ship has since been reconstructed, and is on display in the Boat Museum, directly above the pit in which it was found.  ","

        Pyramid Complex of Khafre (Khefren)

He built the second pyramid complex at Giza, and constructed his tomb on slightly higher ground, making it appear just as tall as his father’s. At 143.5 meters in height, however, his pyramid is only slightly shorter, and a tremendously impressive monument. Its core masonry is made of blocks of local limestone. The top of the pyramid still preserves the beautifully polished blocks of high-quality limestone that once encased the majority of the structure’s towering height. This white stone was quarried in Tura, south of Maadi, and transported here by ship.             The mortuary temple of Khafre at the foot of his pyramid and the valley temple at the end of the causeway are larger than any of those of older pyramids, and also among the best preserved of the Old Kingdom. Another development in the reign of Khafre is the complexity of their layout, with the elements constituting his mortuary temple becoming the new standard that its later Old Kingdom counterparts would follow. A unique feature of Khafre’s complex is the inclusion of a colossal statue beside his valley temple—the Great Sphinx. The valley temple is made of massive limestone blocks encased in granite, floors made of alabaster, and its wide hall features monolithic granite pillars. The symmetrically arranged niches along the walls of the hall once accommodated statues of the king, some of which are currently on display in the Egyptian Museum. One of these, the famous granodiorite statue of Khafre with Horus as a falcon perched behind his head, is widely considered one of the masterpieces of ancient Egyptian art.   ","

        The Great Sphinx

It was carved directly out of the bedrock during the Fourth Dynasty (c.2613–2494 BC), which also makes it the oldest. Ancient Egyptian sphinxes represented the king with the body of a lion, in a clear demonstration of his power.             The evidence points to the Great Sphinx having been carved during the reign of Khafre (Khefren to the ancient Greeks; c.2558–2532 BC), the builder of the second of the Giza pyramids. The Great Sphinx and the temple in front of it, called the Sphinx Temple, lie directly next to Khafre’s valley temple and the lower portion of the causeway leading up to his mortuary temple and pyramid. Careful archaeological analysis has revealed that the valley temple was finished before work was begun on the Great Sphinx and its temple. Analysis of the Great Sphinx’s facial features has also revealed striking similarities with those of Khafre’s statues.             The Great Sphinx has captured the imagination of travelers and explorers for millennia, even in ancient Egyptian times. During the Eighteenth Dynasty (c.1550–1295 BC), it came to be seen as a manifestation of the sun god, and was called Horemakhet “Horus in the Horizon”. King Amenhotep II (c.1427–1400 BC) built a temple next to the Sphinx, which he dedicated to this god. His son, Thutmose IV (c.1400–1390 BC), erected a monumental stela between its front paws, called the Dream Stela, on which he recorded a fascinating event.  ","

        Pyramid Complex of Menkaure (Mykerinos)

He was most likely the son of Khafre (Khefren), and grandson of Khufu (Cheops). With a base area that is less than a quarter of their pyramids’, and with an original height of 65 meters, Menkaure’s is by far the smallest of the three. This reduction in size is due to several factors, including the limited amount of space left on the Giza Plateau. The material used for the outer casing of Menkaure’s pyramid is another. Whereas his predecessors had used limestone for this purpose, Menkaure employed granite, which was quarried in Aswan, over 800 km away. In addition to the logistics involved in transportation of the granite blocks, the material itself is much harder than limestone. However, only the bottom quarter of the casing stones are made of granite however, the rest being limestone.           Like the Great Pyramid, three smaller pyramids can be seen next to Menkaure’s as well, which were used for the burials of his queens. No satellite pyramid has been discovered, however, but it is believed that the largest of the three queens’ pyramids was in fact originally intended to have been the satellite pyramid.            Menkaure died before his pyramid complex was completed, and much of the pyramid’s granite casing blocks were not smoothed. His mortuary and valley temples were intended to consist of colossal limestone blocks encased in granite, but were actually completed with whitewashed mudbrick. Despite this, however, the mortuary cult of Menkaure was practiced for another 300 years after his death.  ","

This cemetery was reserved for the closest relatives of the king, and contains some of the largest mastabas on the Giza Plateau. The term mastaba (Arabic for “bench”) refers to a type of funerary structure that was generally rectangular in shape and built over the tomb proper, which was underground. The mastaba of Khufukhaf I includes two burial shafts, one for him, and another for his wife, Neferetkau.             The chapel of Khufukhaf I, inside the mastaba, where his funerary cult was conducted, is very well preserved. Many beautiful scenes survive that show him and his wife receiving a wide variety of offerings, which they would both need in the afterlife.             A scene in the chapel depicts him holding his mother’s hand. The hieroglyphic inscriptions beside her reveal that she was the mother of a king, but her name is missing. It is thought that this is Henutsen, one of Khufu’s wives, who is believed to have been buried in one of the three queens’ pyramids next-door. The inscriptions in Khufukhaf I’s mastaba also identify him as a vizier, the highest-ranking official in ancient Egyptian administration. As a vizier and the son of a queen, there is no doubt that Khufukhaf I was one of the most powerful people in the kingdom during his lifetime.  ","

This was where the workers who built the pyramid complexes of Khafre (c.2558–2532 BC) and Menkaure (c.2532–2503 BC) lived. The tantalising remains of an even older settlement underneath may date to Khufu’s reign (c.2589–2566 BC). Houses, magazines, three main streets, and a royal administrative building were discovered within the city walls, as were four huge galleries. These may have been the barracks in which the workers who built the pyramids slept and prepared their food. An enormous amount of fish, bird, cattle, sheep, goat, and pig bones were found, revealing that the state ensured that the workers were in good health so they could fulfill their physically demanding responsibilities.           On the hillside immediately to the west of Heit al-Ghurab is the town’s cemetery. Low-ranking overseers of workmen were buried in modest mastabas on the low slopes of the hill, surrounded by even smaller mastaba or domed tombs, possibly those of their extended families and the workers they supervised. These were largely built of mudbrick, whereas the higher-ranking overseers and skilled craftsmen were buried in large stone mastabas higher up the slope. Among these is the beautifully decorated tomb of the overseer of linen, the overseer of the royal house of purification, Nefertheith. The majority of the bodies discovered show evidence of hard physical labor, many even featuring broken bones. Most of these had healed correctly, however, indicating that, in addition to being well-fed, the workers also received very good medical care.   ","

Called the Eastern and Western Cemeteries after their positions relative to the Great Pyramid, they include the tombs of members of the royal family and the highest-ranking nobles. As such, they contain some of the most beautiful tomb decoration from this period.             The cemeteries consist mostly of mastabas, but rock-cut tombs are attested as well. The term mastaba (Arabic for “bench”) refers to a type of funerary structure that was generally rectangular in shape and built over the tomb proper, which was underground. Most of the mastabas of the Eastern and Western Cemeteries were built during the reign of Khufu, in tandem with his pyramid complex, whereas the rock-cut tombs were for the most part built later.             Most of the tombs of the Eastern Cemetery dating to the reign of Khufu were intended for his closest relatives. The rock-cut tomb of his mother, queen Hetepheres I, along with her funerary equipment, was discovered here, and it is the site of the mastaba of his half-brother Ankh-haf, who had an important administrative position in the construction of the Great Pyramid. On the other hand, the mastabas of the Western Cemetery, which are mostly arranged in an orderly grid, were reserved for very high-ranking noblemen that were not as closely related to the king. Among them is the monumental mastaba of Hemiunu, who oversaw the building of the Great Pyramid.  ","

Both very large and exquisitely decorated, this is indeed a tomb worthy of her rank—and fortunately also contains the best preserved wall reliefs in the Eastern Cemetery.           These are decorated with a diverse array of scenes, including bread baking, beer brewing, fowling, herding, mat making, metal smelting, and the sculpting of statues, apparently of Meresankh herself. These, along with the elaborate scenes of offering-bearers bringing all sorts of gifts to Meresankh, were intended to magically provide her soul with a continuous stream of food and goods in the afterlife. Interestingly, among the objects being brought to her are a canopy with a bed being set up within it, an armchair, and a carrying chair. Actual examples of very similar objects were discovered in the tomb of Hetepheres I, the mother of Kufu, and can be seen today at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.           Among the most striking features of Meresankh’s tomb chapel is a series of ten large statues of women that are carved out of the northern wall. It is believed that they represent, in addition to Meresankh herself, her mother, and daughters as well.  ","

        The Step Pyramid Complex of Djoser

It constitutes a significant historical turning point in ancient Egyptian funerary monuments, revolutionizing stone architecture and royal burials. In addition to its beauty and monumental scale, it is not only the very first pyramid that the ancient Egyptians ever built, but also the oldest known ancient Egyptian stone structure. The sheer age of the Step Pyramid is astounding. It was built in the early Third Dynasty, during the reign of King Netjerykhet (c.2667–2648 BC), who is now more well-known as Djoser. Before his reign, royal and elite Egyptians were buried in mastabas. This word, meaning “bench” in Arabic, refers to a type of funerary structure that was generally rectangular in shape and built over the tomb proper, which was underground. The Step Pyramid is composed of six stacked mastabas, thus creating the stepped effect. Imhotep, its architect, may very well have been responsible for this major innovation. At one end of the pyramid complex, a structure known as the South Tomb is believed to have acted as an additional, symbolic, tomb for Djoser, perhaps reflecting his role as the dual king of both Upper and Lower Egypt. Djoser’s pyramid complex also has some unique features. The two courts in front of the pyramid recreate the setting of the Sed Festival, a royal ceremony aimed at rejuvenating the king and regenerating his power. The structures on the side of the eastern court emulate in stone the ephemeral shrines that were used in this festival, thus ensuring that the king could continue being rejuvenated forever.

Upon completion, it stood 52.5 m tall. Although it was originally encased in blocks of fine limestone, its core consists of small blocks of local limestone and debris fill. This meant that, when the casing blocks were removed in antiquity, the core, unable to sustain its shape, began to droop. The pyramid appears little different from a natural hill today as a result. Its substructure, however, is intact.           A descending passageway turns into a horizontal corridor, which leads to an antechamber. Three magazines for burial equipment lie on the left, but since the pyramid was robbed in antiquity, these were found empty. On the right, west, side is the burial chamber. Its ceiling is decorated with gold stars against a dark blue background, reflecting the ancient Egyptian notion of the tomb as a microcosm of the universe. The end of the corridor, and the entirety of the antechamber and burial chamber are beautifully decorated with Pyramid Texts. These are a collection of rituals and recitations that were designed to ensure the king’s successful journey to the afterlife. The originally intended decorative programme was never completed, however, indicating the king’s untimely death. The third century BC ancient Egyptian priest and historian Manetho recorded that Teti was killed by his bodyguards, but there is little evidence to support this.          Some fragments have been discovered of the mortuary temple of Teti’s pyramid complex despite the fact that most of its blocks were robbed in antiquity. His valley temple has not been located yet. A large cemetery for the burials of Teti’s officials lies in front of his pyramid. Some of the grandest and most beautifully decorated tombs of the Old Kingdom are located here, such as the mastabas of the viziers Mereruka and Kagemni.  ","

As with most pyramids, two temples linked by a long causeway compose part of the pyramid complex. The remains of the valley temple can be seen at the modern entrance to the site of Saqqara.

The tomb is a mastaba (Arabic for “bench”), a type of funerary structure that was generally rectangular in shape and built over the tomb proper, which was underground. The chapel of the tomb, where the cult of the tomb owners would be practiced, was generally located within the mastaba itself. Here, in addition to the chapel rooms within the mastaba, a part of it was cut out of the rock.          The walls of the tomb are decorated with lively scenes of fishing with nets and spears, agriculture, butchery, gardening, carpentry, and jewelry‑making. Another scene depicts a banquet during which both tomb owners are entertained by singers and dancers while musicians play their instruments. In an interesting tribute to the Two Brothers’ own profession, another scene shows barbers, manicurists and pedicurists at work.           One particular scene, which is generally reserved for a man and his wife, depicts Niankh‑Khnum and Khnumhotep in an intimate scene, standing close to one another. This, combined with the fact that they were both buried in the same tomb, has led to much speculation. Due to several factors, including the fact that each of them is represented with his wife, it is believed that Niankh‑Khnum and Khnumhotep were identical twins  ","

As vizier, the highest-ranking official, and husband of a daughter of Teti’s, Mereruka was a very powerful and wealthy man. It is all the more significant that he held this title during the reigns of the first two rulers of the Sixth Dynasty, a time when the elite’s power had grown substantially.           Mereruka was buried in a mastaba to the north of the pyramid of Teti in Saqqara. Reflecting his status, it is among the largest in the Teti cemetery, and among the most exquisitely decorated tombs of the Old Kingdom (c.2686–2181 BC). The rooms inside the mastaba were often the venue for the performance of the cult for the soul of the tomb owner. Mereruka’s massive mastaba contains a total of thirty rooms, including five for his wife, and another five for his son.            Many beautiful scenes adorning the walls of this tomb provide insight into life during the Old Kingdom, such as the herding of cattle through marshes, the harpooning of hippopotami, and fishing and fowling scenes, all of which are shown in amazingly vivid detail. Also shown are scenes of animals being force-fed, although exceptionally hyenas are depicted among them. A unique scene depicts personifications of the three seasons of the ancient Egyptian calendar. The focal point of the entire tomb was the false-door. In Mereruka’s mastaba, a life-size statue of him steps out, ready to receive the offerings that were set on the offering table before him.

This is also the site of the tomb Horemheb was planning for himself before he became king.           Like most private tombs, the tombs of this New Kingdom cemetery consist of two parts: a sealed underground section that includes the burial chamber, and the above‑ground, accessible, tomb chapel, where the cult of the deceased was practised. What sets the tombs of this cemetery apart, however, is the fact that they are neither mastabas nor rock‑cut, but free‑standing structures known as temple‑tombs. The larger tombs, like the great state temples of the period (hence their name), were entered through a pylon gateway that led into an open‑air courtyard that preceded the tomb chapel. The central chapel would have been surmounted by a small pyramid, a symbol of rebirth. A shaft in the forecourt led to the underground burial chamber.           This section of Saqqara was explored by tomb robbers and art dealers in the 19th century. Many statues and reliefs were taken without being recorded, and sold to museums and collectors abroad. A 19th century map of the area made by Prussian Egyptologist Karl R. Lepsius led to the rediscovery of the New Kingdom cemetery in 1975 by the Anglo‑Dutch expedition of the Egypt Exploration Society (EES) in London and the National Museum of Antiquities, Leiden, led by Geoffrey T. Martin.  ","

        Memphite Tomb of Horemheb

Prior to his ascension to the throne, during the reign of Tutankhamun (c.1336–1327 BC), he was the highest‑ranking military officer in the realm, and held other titles as lofty as “the King’s Deputy in the Entire Land”. He was ultimately buried in the Valley of the Kings as would befit his royal status. Before this, however, Horemheb had naturally begun work on another tomb, in Saqqara.           This tomb is the largest in the New Kingdom cemetery south of the causeway of the Fifth Dynasty King Unas (c.2375–2345 BC). Like the other major tombs in this cemetery, it is a temple‑tomb, so named because it reflects the structure of contemporary great state temples. It is entered through a pylon gateway preceding two open‑air courtyards that themselves precede the inner rooms of the chapel, where Horemheb’s cult was practised. The central room was surmounted by a pyramid, a solar symbol of rebirth. The burial chamber was underground, accessed through a vertical shaft cut through the floor of the inner courtyard. The discovery of the bones of a fetus along with a female skeleton, possibly of Horemheb’s wife Mutnedjmet, in his Memphite tomb shows that it did not go unused. The reliefs in this tomb include scenes depicting Horemheb carrying out his duties. One scene shows representatives of foreign rulers pleading before Tutankhamun, with Horemheb acting as intermediary. Two scenes in particular show his exalted status prior to his rise to kingship. Here, he is depicted followed by rows of foreign captives, being publicly rewarded with the Gold of Honor by Tutankhamun himself. The Gold of Honor was awarded by kings to their officials for exceptional service. The tomb is decorated with funerary scenes as well, one of which depicts the Opening of the Mouth ritual.             The location of this tomb was not always known. It was discovered in the early 19th century, when this area of Saqqara was explored by tomb‑robbers and art dealers, who then sold their findings to museums and collectors abroad. These were not limited to statues and other portable objects. Entire sections of wall relief were removed, and none of the provenance was recorded. Horemheb’s Memphite tomb was particularly affected, and its location was subsequently forgotten. Thankfully, it and the New Kingdom cemetery were eventually rediscovered in 1975. ","

The palace reflects the high status of its owner and marks a major milestone in the urban landscape of Heliopolis. Baron Empain's palace is the most prominent Monuments in the capital, its unique and innovative image attracting crowds of pedestrians on the road. It was founded by Edward Louis Joseph Empain between 1907 and 1911. He was a Belgian businessman who was awarded the title ""Baron"" by the King of Belgium, on account of his economic contributions. The French architect Alexander Marcel was tasked with building this masterpiece. The interior design of the palace consists of three floors topped by a roof. The palace is surrounded by a large garden from all sides. As for the basement, it contained a residence for the palace's servants, and consisted of a group of rooms connected by corridors and doors. The palace building is surrounded by a spiral staircase and an elevator that connects all the palace floors with a basement.
The ground floor consists of a reception room, a dining room, and a billiard room. As for the first floor, it houses four rooms, each with its own balcony and bathroom.  Finally, the roof of the palace comes as an open space on one of the sides of the tower, characteristic of the Baron Palace.   ","

Built by the Fatimid vizier and commander‑in‑chief, Badr al‑Jamali, in 480 AH/1092 AD, it defined Cairo’s new southernmost extent, displacing the original, brick, Bab Zuwayla (now lost). Its builder, the Fatimid commander of the armies, was Jawhar al‑Siqilli, who conquered Egypt and founded Cairo. Among his troops were members of the eponymous tribe of Zuwayla, who were quartered near the gate. The minarets were not added until 818 AH/1415 AD, when the Mamluk Sultan al‑Mua'yyad Shaykh built a mosque next to Bab Zuwayla.           Bab Zuwayla was also known as Bawabbat al‑Mitwalli, because the mitwalli al‑hesba, the official in charge of finances and tax collection, was based here. According to local folklore, the spirit of al‑Mitwalli ""one of the righteous friends of Allah"", resides in this area, and performs miracles.           Bab Zuwayla witnessed the end of Mamluk rule when the Ottoman Sultan, Selim I, hanged the last Mamluk Sultan, Tumanbay in 922 AH/1517 AD.

The mosque consists of an open courtyard at its center surrounded by four riwaqs (arcades) topped by shallow domes, the largest of which marks the qibla, the direction of prayer.

The construction of the mosque was begun by al‑Hakim’s father, the Fatimid Caliph al‑‘Aziz bi‑Allah in 379 AH/989 AD, but he died before its completion, leaving his son to finish it in 403 AH/1013 AD. The mosque is located at the end of al‑Mu’izz Street in al‑Jamaliya district, between Bab al‑Futuh and Bab al‑Nasr.           The main entrance lies on the western side of the mosque, and is monumental in size and design. It is one of the oldest architectural examples of projecting stone porches, and was influenced by the great Mosque of Mahdiya in Tunis. The mosque once served as a Shiite center in Egypt, and is comparable to the role al‑Azhar Mosque would later play for Sunni Islam.           The mosque has a long and intriguing history, including its role as a barracks during the French campaign, when its minarets were utilized as watch-towers. Originally, the mosque was constructed as an enclosure by the Fatimid Vizier Gawhar al‑Siqilli (d. 382 AH/992 AD), and was later incorporated into the fortifications built by the general Badr al‑Jamali (d. 487 AH/1094 AD). The plan of the mosque consists of an irregular triangle with four arcades centering a courtyard. Two minarets flank either side of the façade, and they have undergone several restoration phases throughout their lifetime.  ","

It opens onto the historic al‑Mu’izz Street, which leads to the only surviving southern gate of the city, Bab Zuwayla. It was built by the vizier and commander‑in‑chief, Badr al‑Jamali, during the reign of the Fatimid Caliph al‑Mustansir Billah. This stone structure was built farther north than the older, brick, gate of Jawhar al‑Siqilli, thus both giving the city room to expand, as well as tougher defenses. Bab al‑Futuh and Bab al‑Nasr, both of which were built in 480 AH/1087 AD, along with Bab Zuwayla (480 AH/1092 AD), are among the rare examples of military architecture in the Islamic world prior to the Crusades.           As its dating inscription attests, this gate was founded as Bab al-Iqbal (Gate of Prosperity), but the inhabitants of Cairo continued to refer to it by the name of the older monument it replaced, Bab al‑Futuh. The two towers of the gate have rounded fronts, and are linked by a platform, which features shafts in its floor through which boiling oil could be poured on invaders. The arch is splayed, and decorated with a lattice of diamonds, each containing a sculpted shape. Also worth noting are the beautifully decorated corbel stones above the arch. The two at either end terminate in ram heads, symbolizing al‑Qahir (Mars), which was on the ascendant upon the founding of Cairo. This gave the new city its name, al‑Qahira “The Conqueror”.

Deeming it insufficient for the protection of the city, Badr decided to construct a new, stone, tower, which he sited farther north, thus also giving Cairo more room to expand. Although this new structure was founded as Bab al‑‘Izz (Gate of Glory, or Power), it continued to be known by the name of the old tower, Bab al‑Nasr.           Around halfway up the height of the gates, running along the bottom of the cornice, is the monument’s dating inscription. It is written in Kufic, and masterfully executed in raised relief. It identifies the gate’s official name, and the year in which it was founded.           A series of shields worked in raised relief adorns the outer face of the gate and its towers. These are likely suggestive of the protective role of the Fatimid fortifications, which are acting as the shields of the city. ","

It is located in the Citadel’s southern section. The Mamluk sultan, al‑Nasir Muhammad, over the course of his forty‑two‑year reign that was interrupted three times, built more monuments than any other ruler of the Mamluk ruler. He decreed that this mosque be built in 718 AH/1318 AD. After it was completed, however, he demolished it and rebuilt it in 735 AH/1335 AD. This mosque was highly cherished by subsequent Mamluk sultans, and used by the Mamluk occupants of the Citadel.           The mosque is among the most prominent monuments within the Citadel due to its unique style that merges many architectural traditions. The tops of its two minarets and dome were once covered in green tiles, and are influenced by an eastern Islamic style. The inside of the dome is decorated with a bar of Quranic verses, the titles of Sultan al‑Nasir Muhammad, and the date of the building of the second mosque. The ceiling of the mosque is decorated with beautiful geometric shapes. The ornate minbar (pulpit) is made of wood, inlaid with ivory and mother‑of‑pearl, and inscribed with the name of King Farouk.           The mosque was used as storage and prison during the British occupation of 1882 AD. This led to its destruction, but it was subsequently restored in 1948 AD.  ","

The total cost of the project exceeded one million dinars. Because the project was executed on such a massive scale, it attracted many artisans and craftsmen from different provinces of the Mamluk empire.           Its proximity to the citadel ultimately resulted in its use as a fort by enemies several times throughout its history. Some sultans seriously considered demolishing it because enemy armies would use the mosques high platforms to launch attacks on the citadel.           Like most Islamic monuments in Cairo, this one has also undergone several phases of reconstruction, up until the twentieth century. The interior and exterior domes of the mosque are extremely ornate, and their designs may have been inspired by Armenian art and architecture.           A monumental iwan opens up on each of the four sides of the interior square courtyard. An iwan is a vaulted rectangular space that is open on one side. Doorways at the four corners of the courtyard allow access into four madrasas, educational institutions, where the four Sunni Islamic schools were taught.","

It is a monumental structure that dwarfs the surrounding landscape. The mosque gets its name from imam Ahmad al‑Rifa’i (512–578 AH/1118–1181/2 AD), who founded the Rifa’i tariqa (Sufi path). Although he was never buried here, the mosque is the site of joyous annual Sufi celebrations commemorating his birth.           The original structure was a Fatimid mosque, which was then transformed into a shrine for Ali abu Sheibak. Finally, Ottoman queen Kosheir Hanim commissioned the current design of the mosque and put in charge of the construction the architect Hussein Pasha Fahmi. Part of the plan was to have a mausoleum for the royal family as part of the extension, which was made by imported building materials from Europe, such as Italian marble. In addition to traditional raw materials, cement has also been employed in the construction of the mosque—a first for any Islamic monument in Egypt—signaling the transition into modern times.           Al‑Rifa’i Mosque’s architectural design is as interesting as its construction history. Visitors stand in awe of the detailed decoration of the outer walls and massive columns of the outer gate. The minarets are distinguished by their beauty and elegance.           While a section of the mosque is dedicated to prayers, another is reserved for the members of the family of Muhammad Ali Pasha, which was in power from the early nineteenth century until the 1952 revolution, when the modern Egyptian republic was born. Khedive Ismail and his mother Hoshiyar Qadin, as well as Kings Fuad I and Faruq, the last two rulers of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty, are buried here, all enshrined in elaborate tombs. The mosque briefly also served as the burial place of Reza Shah (king) of Iran (d.1363 AH/1944 AD), but he was returned to his home country following the end of World War II. Part of his burial chamber, however, is occupied by his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (d. 1400 AH/1980 AD), the last Shah of Iran. ","

          The house is located just off Salah al-Din (or Maydan al-Qal’a “Citadel Square”) in Cairo, and is considered one of the best-preserved structures exhibiting domestic architecture. It was popularly known as the House of Artists because many artists, such as Ragheb Ayyad and Shadi Abd al-Salam, resided there.
          The house’s architecture was inspired by Ottoman and Mamluk styles. The rooms feature the collections of architectural pioneers such as Ramses Wissa Wassef and the internationally renowned architect Hasan Fathi. Paintings adorn the upper hall depicting Cairo's buildings and parks. The roof of the house looks onto a magnificent landscape of Cairo’s historic urban landmarks.
          The house was neglected towards the end of the 20th century until it was renovated at the turn of the millennium. In the 21st century, Ali Labib House was converted into a museum of architecture, and is where the House of Egyptian Architecture is based.    ","

        Ibn Tulun Mosque

Construction began in 263 AH/876 AD, and finished in 266 AH/879 AD. Located on Jebal Yashkur, the mosque was meant to serve as the main congregational mosque of ibn Tulun’s new administrative capital, al-Qata’i.
          The building of this mosque was a further step in asserting Ahmad ibn Tulun’s independence from the ʿAbbasid Caliphate. Immediately striking is the mosque’s minaret, which echoes the designs of the ʿAbbasid mosque in Samarra, Iraq. However, the date of its construction is disputed, some suggesting that it was a later addition to the plan.
          The arches and the windows of the mosque’s courtyard contain stucco designs of geometric and foliated designs. A water fountain is positioned in the center of the courtyard, surmounted by a dome supported by marble columns. The interior of the mosque contains six mihrabs. The mihrab is a niche in the wall of a mosque that marks the qibla, the direction of the Kaaba in Mecca, which Muslims face during prayer. The main mihrab is concave, and elaborately decorated.
          In the medieval period, several small houses plotted the mosque’s exterior, some being built right up against the mosque’s walls. For this reason, mosques were often built with an enclosure wall. The resulting empty space between the outer wall and the mosque, called a ziyada, separated the religious world from the secular outside. With the exception of Bayt al-Kritliyya and Beit Amna bint Salim, the structures that had been built up against the outer wall were demolished in the twentieth century. Today, the mosque largely survives in its original form, but is rarely used for congregational prayers.    ","

It was named after its patron, Mrs. Banba Kaden bint ‘Abdallah al-Bayda in 1284 AH/1867 AD as a waqf for her late son ‘Abbas Helmi I (1280–1296 AH/1863–1879 AD), the governor of Egypt and cousin of Khedive Isma’il Pasha.           The Sabil-Kuttab historically functioned as a public water fountain surmounted or annexed by a school, and Um ‘Abbas’ Sabil-Kuttab counts among the most exquisite of the structures on al-Saliba Street. Decorated in marble floral designs, the architecture was inspired by European Rococo designs. It is a testament to the sophisticated hydraulic system of nineteenth-century Cairo.           It was mainly the Holy Quran that was taught to children in the Kuttab. Graffiti on the walls in Arabic and Turkish dialects commemorate this classroom environment. One inscription in particular is signed off by the calligrapher ‘Abdallah al-Zuhdi al-Nabulsi.  ","

In 745 AH / 1344 AD, it became more commonly known as the dome of Shaykh Hasan Sadaqah al‑Sharabishi. The school’s plan consists of an open courtyard, of which only a water fountain survives. The court is surrounded by the remains of small Ottoman‑style rooms which were reserved for students. The Mawlawiyya Takiyya itself was established in 1005 AH / 1595 AD, and served as a hospice for the poor. Its façade was distinguished by a fusion of Mamluk and Ottoman styles. The takiyya became a place of residence for Sufi dervishes of the Mawlawi (Mevlevi) order starting the seventeen century, after which it moved to another location.           The most important characteristic of the The Mawlawiyya Takiyya is the dome of its ceiling, which is built on twelve wooden pillars. The structure has two floors: the ground floor contains eight rooms with wooden ceilings, and the second contains eight different rooms of different sizes and purposes.           The Dervish stage, built in 1810 AD, is dedicated to Mawlawi gatherings of dhikr, ”supplication to god”. It is composed of a circular wooden platform surrounded by a wooden handrail which has two doors. Here the dervishes perform circular movements as a form of dhikr. The second floor above this space is reserved for guests and women, and is reached by means of a wooden staircase.  ","

The history of the church is still being debated. Some scholars believe that it dates to the late fourth to early fifth centuries AD, while others believe that it should approximately be dated to 17th century AD.          This church has acquired a special religious status among Coptic churches because it is associated with the Holy Family's journey through Egypt. It is named after renowned early fourth century AD saints, Sergius and Bacchus, both of whom were martyred at al-Resafa in Syria for their Christian beliefs.           Like various other early Christian churches, the Church of Abu Serga and its underground cave are designed in the basilica layout, and thus together consist of three parts: the narthex, nave, and sanctuary (the cave being below the sanctuary). The church is characterized by its unique architectural and artistic elements that reflect the spirit of Coptic church architecture in Egypt. These include the pulpit, baptismal font, inlaid ivory and wood templon, and unique religious decoration of the saints and apostles decorating the various domes, walls and columns.  ","

It was once the center of many celebrations, congregations and prayers, but is no longer in use today. The origin of the building is uncertain. Some believe that it was once a Coptic Orthodox Church that was sold to members of Egypt’s Jewish community in 882 AD. The synagogue is named after Abraham ibn ‘Ezra, the Jewish religious scholar and philosopher.
Ben ‘Ezra contains all the main features of a synagogue. The bimah, or pulpit, from which prayers were read is in its center. The most sacred feature of a synagogue, the hekhal, which marks the direction of prayer, is decorated in Arabesque style and inlaid with mother of pearl, displaying a merge of artistic traditions. The Ten Commandments are inscribed on it in Hebrew.           Every synagogue keeps a geniza, a repository for old documents mentioning the name of God, which could not be simply discarded. Ben ‘Ezra’s was especially large. It had accumulated documents over a span of 850 years. This treasure of historical documents was discovered by Europeans in 1888, and is now housed in libraries around the world. The Cairo Geniza, as it is known today, includes many rare and previously unknown documents.   ","

General ʿAmr ibn al-ʿAs (d. 664) was one of the first companions of the Prophet Muhammad. After conquering Egypt in 19 AH/640 AD, he founded its first Islamic capital, Fustat, which falls within the modern city of Cairo. A year later, by order of the Caliph ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab, he also founded the eponymous mosque of ‘Amr ibn al-‘As, which thus became the new capital’s very first building. During the early years following the conquest, the mosque served as a place of gathering for Muslim community and ‘Amr’s troops, which at the time remained a minority in Egypt. Several of the Prophet’s companions assisted in the building’s construction, including al-Zubayr ibn al-‘Awam and Ubada ibn al-Samit. The structure was subjected to several episodes of destruction, and has therefore undergone many architectural changes throughout its lifetime, such that very little of the original survives today. What currently stands in Old Cairo is the mosque’s twentieth century reconstruction. However, it remains true to the modesty of Islamic architecture in its earliest form, evolving from a shed with palm-tree columns to the elegant arcade halls that still house prayers to this day.

If the flood was too high, the water would cause destruction, and would also eventually recede late in the year, disrupting the agricultural cycle. If it was too low, the soil would not be resupplied with nutrients, and agriculture would be impossible. Both outcomes could result in food shortages, or even famine. Nilometers, as their name suggests, were used to measure flood levels so that dykes, levees, and canals could be prepared accordingly. Flood levels affected agricultural productivity, so another major purpose of Nilometers was to set taxation levels. Built on the order of the Abbasid Caliph al-Mutawakkil in 247 AH/861 AD, the Nilometer on Rawda Island is one of the oldest in Egypt. It is also the oldest structure built after the Arab conquest (20 AH/641 AD) that survives in its original form. The annual seven‑day celebration of the Nile flood, which took place from the medieval period down to the end of the nineteenth century, was attended by the sultan himself along with his senior officials. The Rawda Island Nilometer consists of a marble octagonal column 19 cubits in length in the middle of a stone-lined well that is rectangular at the top, and circular at the bottom. Quranic texts relating to water, vegetation, and prosperity are carved on the walls of the well, as are measuring marks, which were used to determine the height of the flood as the water rose through the well. A stairway spirals down to the bottom. ","

Its valuable collection is a beacon for visitors, who come in reverence to admire its rare relics for their artistic qualities           Currently, it is the smallest surviving monastery of Wadi Natrun and is the most famous amongst clergymen and scholars around the world. Although the monastery’s foundations date back to the fourth century AD, it is known as the Monastery of the Syrians because of a group of al-Surian monks who settled in Wadi Natrun in 984 AD.           The monastery includes a number of monumental buildings including a fortress, a group of monastic cells, and three large churches named the Virgin Mary, the Cave of Virgin Mary, the Church of Archangel Michael.           The Church of the Virgin Mary is the monastery’s main church. Built in 645 AD, it is also its oldest building after the Cave of Anba Bishoy to its west, and features beautiful engravings covering its walls, doors, and domes. In 1994, a team of researchers from the University of Leiden examining the plaster layers covering the walls of the church discovered many frescos (wall paintings) from the seventh to eighteenth centuries AD. Among the depictions are the birth and death of the Virgin Mary, and Jesus Christ carrying her soul.           An extensive and rare collection of Syriac manuscripts was discovered in the monastery’s library during the nineteenth century. This unparalleled collection, currently housed in the Vatican Library and other institutions, includes some of the oldest Greek texts by Aristotle, Euclid, and Hippocrates.","

The development of Alexandrian tombs can be traced here, from modest shaft graves, through gallery tombs, to the monumental hypogea.           The Alexandrian hypogeum consisted of a group of underground chambers cut into the bedrock around an open court where the funerary rituals were conducted. Some chambers featured bed-shaped sarcophagi called kline, after “bed” in Greek, but most contained loculi, rectangular burial niches carved into the walls. Many burials consisted of a niche housing an urn containing the remains of the deceased after cremation, a tradition that was imported from Greece.           The majority of what is visible in Shatby today are the ruins of a hypogeum built around 280 BC. It was apparently constructed for a single family, which then employed and expanded it over the course of several generations. Although much of the original decoration is not preserved, enough survives that gives tantalizing hints of the hypogeum’s past grandeur. Many of the walls are sculpted, featuring cornices, engaged columns, and solid, pseudo-windows. Painted garlands once hung between the engaged columns of the court, and painted birds flew against a sky-blue backdrop, providing a simulated beautiful outdoor setting for the funerary rituals that were conducted there.           The kline of the hypogeum, carved out of the bedrock, feature all the parts expected of a bed, including mattress and cushions, in a poignant allegory of death as protracted sleep. Kline, also used for banqueting, afforded the deceased life’s pleasures in death, and transformed the tomb into a home for eternity. ","

The 263 known burials range from simple one-chamber structures to elaborate family mausoleums. Built over an ancient Egyptian cemetery, the style of the chapels fuses both Pharaonic and Christian elements. The cemetery began during the 4th century AD, and continued to be in use to the 11th century.             Early Christian burials continued the now-iconic ancient Egyptian tradition of using coffins and burying the deceased with burial goods. These were placed on shelves in pits dug under the chapels. Mummification was practice in this cemetery long after it had died out in the Nile valley.           The Chapel of the Exodus is one of the earliest in the cemetery. The interior of its dome is decorated in two bands illustrating scenes from the Old Testament. Perhaps the most striking of these shows the Exodus—hence the chapel’s name—with Moses leading the Israelites through the Sinai desert, as Pharaoh’s army gives chase. Other scenes depict Adam and Eve, Noah’s Ark, Daniel in the lion’s den, Jonah and the whale, as well as several other episodes from the Old Testament.           Similar themes are depicted on the dome of the Chapel of Peace, including the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary and others. Greek captions identify the scene that is depicted. The interior walls are also painted with many Byzantine frescoes of grape vines, peacocks, allegorical figures, and inscriptions.           Numerous Arabic graffiti dating from the 9th century to the present day can be seen in some of the chapels, including some by Turkish soldiers who are believed to have been garrisoned at Bagawat in the late 18th century.","

Prince Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda al-Qazdagli, and Ottoman military man, established it in 1157 AH / 1744 AD. Prince Katkhuda was interested in constructing various buildings in Cairo. The sabil consists of the rectangular sabil room and its three facades. Each façade had a copper window and was fronted on the outside with marble basins for drinking. The Sabil’s interior walls were paneled with ceramic tiles (faience) decorated with various ottoman floral motifs.  Some tiles bear an illustration of the Great Mosque in Mecca and verses from the Quran. Above the sabil was a school dedicated to teaching Muslim orphans the Holy Qur’an and the prophetic traditions. The entrance door is surmounted by an inscription consisting of verses of poetry, the name of the founder and the date of completion. There is also a square space inside in which the names of the ‘sleepers of the cave’ were carved and encircled. ","

Built in the year 641 AH / 1243 AD, it became known as the Salhiyya Madrasa, referring to its eponym Sultan Al-Malik Al-Salih Najm Al-Din Ayyub. The madrasa taught the four Sunni jurisprudence schools, replacing the Shi’ite curriculum that had been in place under the Fatimid Dynasty. Each of the four jurisprudence schools has its own allocated area inside the madrasa. This was the first institution of its kind to teach all four of the jurisprudence schools. One of the madrasa’s most important features is its main façade and distinctive minaret above the entrance. Only the western iwan, in which the Malik madhhab was taught, survives. The Mausoleum was built in 647AH\ 1249 AD by Shajarat al-Dur, wife of Sultan Najm al-Din Ayyub, she commissioned the structure for her husband following his death in the battle against the Crusaders in Mansura. He was buried in al-Rawda Citadel and later removed to the mausoleum when it was completed in 648 AH\ 1250 AD.  The dome has one main façade with an entrance overlooking al-Mu’izz Street. A plaque above the main entrance records the date of the Sultan’s death. The wooden cabin inside the dome is a good example of Ayyubid wooden antiques.   ","
