Rock Inscriptions of Sehel Island,"https://egymonuments.gov.eg/media/7854/img_20211213_143705.jpg?crop=0.19818298199546813,0,0.08260458334355876,0&cropmode=percentage&width=645&height=423&rnd=132942370220000000","Sehel Island is one of the largest islands on the Nile, located upstream from the First Cataract in Aswan region, and contained a gold-mine and a quarry for the mining of granite, the hardest stone used in ancient Egypt. The island became a popular resting-spot for the king’s army and trading expeditions making their way upstream into Nubia. As a result, the island contains hundreds of inscriptions and royal cartouches, immortalising countless officials and kings. Many of these inscriptions can be seen on the large granite boulders surrounding the island. There are also many within the boundaries of the temple of the goddess Anuket, who was part of the Elephantine triad, along with her parents Khnum and Satet.

Continual use of this island can be seen from its oldest inscriptions dating to the Middle Kingdom (c. 2034–1650 BC), through until the Graeco-Roman Period when the famous “Famine Stela” was carved in to the natural granite rock. One inscription from the time of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III (c. 1479–1425 BC) records that the Overseer of Construction Works managed the feat of extracting six obelisks from the granite quarries of Aswan.

The Famine Stela

The fascinating text of this stela carved on the face of a granite boulder on Sehel Island tells the story of a nation in crisis, its concerned king, and his efforts to find a solution. Although it was composed and carved in the Ptolemaic Period (332–30 BC), the events are set around 2500 years earlier.

The Famine Stela is inscribed in 32 vertical rows of hieroglyphic script, with a scene above it depicting King Djoser (c. 2686–2667 BC) presenting offerings to the divine triad of Elephantine consisting of the god Khnum, his wife Satet and their daughter Anuket. The country is gripped in seven years of drought and famine and King Djoser summons his famous courtier, the wise Imhotep to find a solution. Imhotep told the king that the inundation came from the sacred spring in Elephantine Island, whose god Khnum was the one who controlled the flow of water. Djoser dutifully made offerings to the gods of Elephantine and Khnum appeared to him in a dream one night, promising him to end the famine by returning the flood. To celebrate the return of prosperity, Djoser built a temple on Elephantine to thank Khnum.    ",Aswan,24 hours daily,free,temple

Situated on the western bank of the Nile, its construction began during the reign of Ptolemy III in 237 BC, but was completed in the reign of Ptolemy XII in 57 BC, 180 years later. The temple remained buried under layers of settlement debris for millennia, which is why its architectural and decorative elements have survived so well. In 1860 the French archaeologist Auguste Mariette uncovered and restored parts of the temple. The temple is fronted by two massive pylons that bear scenes of Ptolemy XII conquering his enemies and worshipping deities. Two large granite statues of the falcon-god Horus stand before the pylons. Once through the pylons you enter into a large Peristyle court lined with columns decorated with floral capitals. Beyond this court are two Hypostyle Halls, the first illustrates the temple’s foundation with the king engaged in worship, the second holds scenes of Horus’ journey in a sacred bark accompanied by the goddess Hathor. From the second Hypostyle Hall is the Transverse Hall, then the Sanctuary of the temple.    ","

        The Temple of Bastet

Originally, Bastet was depicted as a lioness, and later as a cat.
According to the Greek historian ""Herodotus"" who visited “Per Bastet” in the 5th century BC, that despite other temples being more grandiose in appearance, none was more beautiful than the temple of ""Bastet"". This temple would have been surrounded by two channels and lined with trees, thus allowing a wonderful view of the city.
During the 22nd Dynasty, when Per Bastet became the capital of Egypt, the temple of Bastet was extended, and as a result, a lot of material from earlier structures was re-used. The oldest of these are two red granite blocks dating to the reign of the 4th Dynasty king Khufu (c.2589–2566 BC) and king Khafre (c.2558–2532 BC).
Additions to this temple were continued by the second king of the 22nd Dynasty, Osorkon I (c.924–889 BC), with his name appearing frequently at the entrance of the temple. The site contained a monumental gate beyond the peristyle courtyard. This was built by Osorkon II, and decorated with scenes of him celebrating the Heb Sed Festival.
In the far west, there is a long colonnade that leads to a hypostyle hall, also built by Osorkon II, and which contains papyrus and Hathor columns. The far west end of the temple, which comprised the Holy of Holies in the complex (the sanctuary), was renewed by the last Egyptian king of the 30th and final Dynasty, King Nectanebo II (360–343 BC).     ","

The excavation director officially announced the discovery in 1997. The well is distinguished by its Roman architectural style, with the excavation team discovering various pottery vessels from the 1st to 4th centuries AD. Historical sources pertaining to the Holy Family’s Journey in Egypt narrate that they drank from this well when they came to Bubastis on the 24th of Pashons in the Coptic calendar, which corresponds to the 1st of June.

As well as many monuments at the site have led it to become an open air museum, which includes the black granite head of goddess Bastet in the form of a lioness.
In addition, one can find archaeological remains from the monumental gateway of the temple of Bastet, which was built by the 22nd Dynasty king Osorkon II (c.874–850 BC). This structure was entirely covered with depictions of Osorkon II celebrating the Heb Sed Festival. Generally, this purely royal festival aimed to rejuvenate the king and renew his royal power.
At the site there are also a large amount of stone fragments bearing the names and epithets of kings. A sandstone block depicts a standard with human arms surmounted by the Ka-hieroglyph (in the shape of two upraised arms), and a king’s Horus Name was written inside. Although it was fragmentary, it contained the Horus Name of King Nectanebo II / Nekhthorhebyt (360–343 BC), the last king of the 30th and final Dynasty.
The open air museum also includes a group of statues of kings and deities. The most prominent is the red granite statue of the 19th Dynasty King Ramesses II (c.1279–1213 BC) standing between the goddess Hathor and the god Ptah. This in turn is found near a group of Graeco-Roman Period column capitals following the Corinthian style.

It is located around three kilometers to the south of Karnak Temple, to which it was once linked with a processional way bordered with sphinxes. The oldest evidence for this temple dates to the Eighteenth Dynasty (c.1550–1295 BC).           Ipet‑resyt, unlike most other ancient Egyptian temples, is not laid out on an east‑west axis, but is oriented towards Karnak. This is because Luxor Temple was the main venue for one the most important of ancient Egyptian religious celebrations, when the cult images of Amun, his wife Mut, and their son, the lunar god Khonsu, were taken from their temples in Karnak, and transported in a grand procession to Luxor Temple so they could visit the god that resides there, Amenemopet. This was the Opet Festival.           Luxor Temple was not constructed by one single ruler. The oldest existing structure, a shrine, dates to the reign of Hatshepsut (c.1473–1458 BC). The core of the temple was built by Amenhotep III (c.1390–1352 BC). One of the inner rooms contains a series of scenes that are known as the Divine Birth. They tell the amazing story of how the king’s true father was none other than the god Amun himself. The core of the temple is preceded by a columned hall fronted by a courtyard with columns around its perimeter. Amenhotep III also built the Great Colonnade, which consists of two rows of seven colossal columns. Its decoration, most notably the scenes depicting the Opet Festival, were completed by Tutankhamun (c.1336–1327 BC) and Horemheb (c.1323–1295 BC).           Ramesses II (c.1279–1213 BC) made many additions to Luxor Temple. In front of the Great Colonnade, he built a peristyle courtyard and a massive pylon, a gate with two towers that formed the entrance into temples. In addition to many colossal statues, the pylon was also fronted by a pair of 25‑meter‑high obelisks made by this great king, but only one remains in place; the other has been at the Place de la Concorde in Paris since 1835–1836.           In the late third century AD, the Romans built a fort around the temple, and the first room beyond the hypostyle hall of Amenhotep III became its sanctuary. The original wall reliefs were covered with plaster, and painted in the Graeco‑Roman artistic style, depicting Emperor Diocletian (284–305 AD) and his three coregents. Although these had largely disappeared, efforts are under way to restore these to their former glory.","

It lies directly across the Nile from Karnak Temple, the main sanctuary of the god Amun. Hatshepsut’s temple, Djeser-djeseru “the Holy of Holies” was designed by the chief steward of Amun, Senenmut.           The temple consists of three levels each of which has a colonnade at its far end. On the uppermost level, an open courtyard lies just beyond the portico. Mummiform statues of Hatshepsut as Osiris, the god of the dead, lean against its pillars.           This is because Djeser-djeseru is Hatshepsut’s mortuary temple, where her cult was practiced after her death, when she attained the blessed state of Osiris. Far from being devoted solely to her, the temple also includes sections for the cults of her revered father Thutmose I, the goddess Hathor, and the funerary god Anubis. An altar, open to the sky and the sun, was dedicated to the cult of the solar Ra‑Horakhty. Pride of place was given to Amun. At the far end of the upper courtyard, on the temple’s central axis, a passage cut directly into the living rock culminates in his sanctuary.           The temple’s walls are covered with beautiful painted reliefs depicting temple rituals, religious festivals, and even the transportation of obelisks from the quarry to their destination in Karnak Temple. Perhaps most interesting are the reliefs in the portico on the so-called Middle Platform. The decorative programme on the left side depicts Hatshepsut’s expedition to Punt, believed to be located near modern Eritrea. The inhabitants of this land, their dwellings, and surrounding environment are vividly recorded, as are the riches and exotic animals that the Egyptians brought back with them. On the other side of the portico, Hatshepsut relates how she is the rightful king of Egypt. She does this not only by claiming that her father Thutmose I had designated her as his heir, but by stating that her true father was none other than the god Amun himself. ","

The entrance of the temple, with six massive columns surmounted with the head of Hathor,is considered among the most beautiful monuments in Egypt. Sistrums (a musical instrument) closely associated with the goddess, frame her head. The temple of Dendera dates back to the Ptolemaic Period, although evidence points to older structures once existing on the sitedating as far back as  king Pepy II, from the Old Kingdom. Among the temple’s most notable features are astronomical engravings on its ceiling. One of the primary celebrations that took place at Dendera was for the Egyptian New Year. The night before the new year, a statue of Hathor was brought out on a shrine and placed on the roof of the temple to receive the sun’s first rays, which symbolically renewed and the rejuvenated the goddess.

He built the second pyramid complex at Giza, and constructed his tomb on slightly higher ground, making it appear just as tall as his father’s. At 143.5 meters in height, however, his pyramid is only slightly shorter, and a tremendously impressive monument. Its core masonry is made of blocks of local limestone. The top of the pyramid still preserves the beautifully polished blocks of high-quality limestone that once encased the majority of the structure’s towering height. This white stone was quarried in Tura, south of Maadi, and transported here by ship.             The mortuary temple of Khafre at the foot of his pyramid and the valley temple at the end of the causeway are larger than any of those of older pyramids, and also among the best preserved of the Old Kingdom. Another development in the reign of Khafre is the complexity of their layout, with the elements constituting his mortuary temple becoming the new standard that its later Old Kingdom counterparts would follow. A unique feature of Khafre’s complex is the inclusion of a colossal statue beside his valley temple—the Great Sphinx. The valley temple is made of massive limestone blocks encased in granite, floors made of alabaster, and its wide hall features monolithic granite pillars. The symmetrically arranged niches along the walls of the hall once accommodated statues of the king, some of which are currently on display in the Egyptian Museum. One of these, the famous granodiorite statue of Khafre with Horus as a falcon perched behind his head, is widely considered one of the masterpieces of ancient Egyptian art.   ","

It was carved directly out of the bedrock during the Fourth Dynasty (c.2613–2494 BC), which also makes it the oldest. Ancient Egyptian sphinxes represented the king with the body of a lion, in a clear demonstration of his power.             The evidence points to the Great Sphinx having been carved during the reign of Khafre (Khefren to the ancient Greeks; c.2558–2532 BC), the builder of the second of the Giza pyramids. The Great Sphinx and the temple in front of it, called the Sphinx Temple, lie directly next to Khafre’s valley temple and the lower portion of the causeway leading up to his mortuary temple and pyramid. Careful archaeological analysis has revealed that the valley temple was finished before work was begun on the Great Sphinx and its temple. Analysis of the Great Sphinx’s facial features has also revealed striking similarities with those of Khafre’s statues.             The Great Sphinx has captured the imagination of travelers and explorers for millennia, even in ancient Egyptian times. During the Eighteenth Dynasty (c.1550–1295 BC), it came to be seen as a manifestation of the sun god, and was called Horemakhet “Horus in the Horizon”. King Amenhotep II (c.1427–1400 BC) built a temple next to the Sphinx, which he dedicated to this god. His son, Thutmose IV (c.1400–1390 BC), erected a monumental stela between its front paws, called the Dream Stela, on which he recorded a fascinating event.  ","

He was most likely the son of Khafre (Khefren), and grandson of Khufu (Cheops). With a base area that is less than a quarter of their pyramids’, and with an original height of 65 meters, Menkaure’s is by far the smallest of the three. This reduction in size is due to several factors, including the limited amount of space left on the Giza Plateau. The material used for the outer casing of Menkaure’s pyramid is another. Whereas his predecessors had used limestone for this purpose, Menkaure employed granite, which was quarried in Aswan, over 800 km away. In addition to the logistics involved in transportation of the granite blocks, the material itself is much harder than limestone. However, only the bottom quarter of the casing stones are made of granite however, the rest being limestone.           Like the Great Pyramid, three smaller pyramids can be seen next to Menkaure’s as well, which were used for the burials of his queens. No satellite pyramid has been discovered, however, but it is believed that the largest of the three queens’ pyramids was in fact originally intended to have been the satellite pyramid.            Menkaure died before his pyramid complex was completed, and much of the pyramid’s granite casing blocks were not smoothed. His mortuary and valley temples were intended to consist of colossal limestone blocks encased in granite, but were actually completed with whitewashed mudbrick. Despite this, however, the mortuary cult of Menkaure was practiced for another 300 years after his death.  ","

Upon completion, it stood 52.5 m tall. Although it was originally encased in blocks of fine limestone, its core consists of small blocks of local limestone and debris fill. This meant that, when the casing blocks were removed in antiquity, the core, unable to sustain its shape, began to droop. The pyramid appears little different from a natural hill today as a result. Its substructure, however, is intact.           A descending passageway turns into a horizontal corridor, which leads to an antechamber. Three magazines for burial equipment lie on the left, but since the pyramid was robbed in antiquity, these were found empty. On the right, west, side is the burial chamber. Its ceiling is decorated with gold stars against a dark blue background, reflecting the ancient Egyptian notion of the tomb as a microcosm of the universe. The end of the corridor, and the entirety of the antechamber and burial chamber are beautifully decorated with Pyramid Texts. These are a collection of rituals and recitations that were designed to ensure the king’s successful journey to the afterlife. The originally intended decorative programme was never completed, however, indicating the king’s untimely death. The third century BC ancient Egyptian priest and historian Manetho recorded that Teti was killed by his bodyguards, but there is little evidence to support this.          Some fragments have been discovered of the mortuary temple of Teti’s pyramid complex despite the fact that most of its blocks were robbed in antiquity. His valley temple has not been located yet. A large cemetery for the burials of Teti’s officials lies in front of his pyramid. Some of the grandest and most beautifully decorated tombs of the Old Kingdom are located here, such as the mastabas of the viziers Mereruka and Kagemni.  ","

It belongs to Niankh‑Khnum and Khnumhotep, both of whom held the titles “overseer of the manicurists of the Great House” and “prophet of Re at the Sun‑temple of Niuserre” a Fifth‑Dynasty king (c.2445–2421 BC). The tomb is a mastaba (Arabic for “bench”), a type of funerary structure that was generally rectangular in shape and built over the tomb proper, which was underground. The chapel of the tomb, where the cult of the tomb owners would be practiced, was generally located within the mastaba itself. Here, in addition to the chapel rooms within the mastaba, a part of it was cut out of the rock.          The walls of the tomb are decorated with lively scenes of fishing with nets and spears, agriculture, butchery, gardening, carpentry, and jewelry‑making. Another scene depicts a banquet during which both tomb owners are entertained by singers and dancers while musicians play their instruments. In an interesting tribute to the Two Brothers’ own profession, another scene shows barbers, manicurists and pedicurists at work.           One particular scene, which is generally reserved for a man and his wife, depicts Niankh‑Khnum and Khnumhotep in an intimate scene, standing close to one another. This, combined with the fact that they were both buried in the same tomb, has led to much speculation. Due to several factors, including the fact that each of them is represented with his wife, it is believed that Niankh‑Khnum and Khnumhotep were identical twins  ","

The New Kingdom (c.1550–1069 BC) cemetery south of the causeway of Unas is where several important officials of the Eighteenth to Twentieth Dynasties were buried. Among them are Ptahemwia, the “Royal Butler, Clean of Hands” under Kings Akhenaten (c.1352–1336 BC) and Tutankhamun (c.1336–1327 BC), Maya, the overseer of the treasury under Tutankhamun, and Tia, the overseer of the treasury during the reign of Ramses II (c.1279–1213 BC). This is also the site of the tomb Horemheb was planning for himself before he became king.           Like most private tombs, the tombs of this New Kingdom cemetery consist of two parts: a sealed underground section that includes the burial chamber, and the above‑ground, accessible, tomb chapel, where the cult of the deceased was practised. What sets the tombs of this cemetery apart, however, is the fact that they are neither mastabas nor rock‑cut, but free‑standing structures known as temple‑tombs. The larger tombs, like the great state temples of the period (hence their name), were entered through a pylon gateway that led into an open‑air courtyard that preceded the tomb chapel. The central chapel would have been surmounted by a small pyramid, a symbol of rebirth. A shaft in the forecourt led to the underground burial chamber.           This section of Saqqara was explored by tomb robbers and art dealers in the 19th century. Many statues and reliefs were taken without being recorded, and sold to museums and collectors abroad. A 19th century map of the area made by Prussian Egyptologist Karl R. Lepsius led to the rediscovery of the New Kingdom cemetery in 1975 by the Anglo‑Dutch expedition of the Egypt Exploration Society (EES) in London and the National Museum of Antiquities, Leiden, led by Geoffrey T. Martin.  ","

        Memphite Tomb of Horemheb
    ","https://egymonuments.gov.eg/media/5549/dsc_0051.jpg?center=0.34883720930232559,0.53333333333333333&mode=crop&width=645&height=423&rnd=132393731630000000","Horemheb (c.1323–1295 BC) was the last king of the Eighteenth Dynasty. Prior to his ascension to the throne, during the reign of Tutankhamun (c.1336–1327 BC), he was the highest‑ranking military officer in the realm, and held other titles as lofty as “the King’s Deputy in the Entire Land”. He was ultimately buried in the Valley of the Kings as would befit his royal status. Before this, however, Horemheb had naturally begun work on another tomb, in Saqqara.           This tomb is the largest in the New Kingdom cemetery south of the causeway of the Fifth Dynasty King Unas (c.2375–2345 BC). Like the other major tombs in this cemetery, it is a temple‑tomb, so named because it reflects the structure of contemporary great state temples. It is entered through a pylon gateway preceding two open‑air courtyards that themselves precede the inner rooms of the chapel, where Horemheb’s cult was practised. The central room was surmounted by a pyramid, a solar symbol of rebirth. The burial chamber was underground, accessed through a vertical shaft cut through the floor of the inner courtyard. The discovery of the bones of a fetus along with a female skeleton, possibly of Horemheb’s wife Mutnedjmet, in his Memphite tomb shows that it did not go unused. The reliefs in this tomb include scenes depicting Horemheb carrying out his duties. One scene shows representatives of foreign rulers pleading before Tutankhamun, with Horemheb acting as intermediary. Two scenes in particular show his exalted status prior to his rise to kingship. Here, he is depicted followed by rows of foreign captives, being publicly rewarded with the Gold of Honor by Tutankhamun himself. The Gold of Honor was awarded by kings to their officials for exceptional service. The tomb is decorated with funerary scenes as well, one of which depicts the Opening of the Mouth ritual.             The location of this tomb was not always known. It was discovered in the early 19th century, when this area of Saqqara was explored by tomb‑robbers and art dealers, who then sold their findings to museums and collectors abroad. These were not limited to statues and other portable objects. Entire sections of wall relief were removed, and none of the provenance was recorded. Horemheb’s Memphite tomb was particularly affected, and its location was subsequently forgotten. Thankfully, it and the New Kingdom cemetery were eventually rediscovered in 1975. ","

        Muhammad Ali Mosque

It was built by Muhammad Ali Pasha (1220–1264 AH/1805–1848 AD), the founder of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty (1220–1372 AH/1805–1953 AD), on the site of Mamluk palaces. He had these demolished to make room for his new building, which is also known as the ""Alabaster Mosque"", in reference to its marble paneling on its interior and exterior walls. The mosque’s twin minarets are the highest in all of Egypt, each reaching a height of 84 meters. The outer open court contains a copper clock tower, which was gifted to Muhammad Ali Pasha by Louis Philippe of France in 1262 AH/1845 AD. Muhammad Ali Pasha reciprocated the gesture with an obelisk of Ramesses II’s (c.1279–1213 BC) that stood in front of Luxor Temple. Today, it stands in the Place de la Concorde Square, Paris. Limestone is the mosque’s main building material. Its square plan consists of a central dome supported by four half‑domes, with an additional four smaller domes in the corners of the building. There are two minbars (pulpits) inside the mosque. The original of the two is made of wood decorated in green. The other was a later addition made of marble. The beautiful white marble mausoleum of Muhammad Ali Pasha is situated in the southwestern corner of the mosque, to the right of the entrance. ","

        Isis Temple

Part of the temple was built during the reigns of Ptolemy III and Ptolemy IV but was later on converted into a church, most likely to venerate Saint Mary. The temple is one of the most important archaeological discoveries due to the fact that it was found preserved in great conditions since its discovery in 1871. The temple remains standing tall with its four magnificent walls and roof with distinctive granite panels.           There are two entrances to the temple on the western side; where the main entrance is located in the middle of the facade and the other at the far left of the main entrance. Towards the back wall of the main hall of the temple, one can admire the wonderful scenes depicting the king making offerings to the gods (Satet - Anqet - Khnum) known as the Aswan trinity. During the restoration work of the mission, numerous Coptic inscriptions were revealed, as well as a rare architectural drawing illustrating the original layout of the temple on the walls. This can all be admired in addition to the remains of Roman and Islamic brick dwellings.           In the middle of the temple's façade is the majestic main gate, decorated with colorful scenes and texts, and above which one can find the winged sun disk featured in the middle. The entrance leads to a transverse hall containing three rooms in the middle of the hall of the Holy of Holies.            This section contains three imposing granite altars in the hall, two of which are located on the northern corridor of the main hall, whilst the other altar is situated on the southern corridor in addition to another one inside the Chamber of the Holy of Holies. All of these altars contain the titles of King Ptolemy IV inscribed on them. Some pictorial scenes are featured on the southern pillar of the hall representing a group of saints, thus confirming that the temple was used as a church in later periods. The Chamber of the Holy of Holies is located in the middle of the temple accessible through an entrance topped by the winged sun disk. In addition, it is decorated with a series of wonderful scenes, some of which illustrate beer being served to Isis, whilst other ones represent the goddess Maat being presented to the god Khnum, as well as another scene depicting pure water being poured on the goddess Isis","
