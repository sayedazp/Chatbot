When she and Isis discovered the body of their murdered brother, they stood on either side of him, and resurrected him.

After a long period of decline, Egypt, especially Cairo, witnessed a new era when Muhammad Ali Pasha, the founder of modern Egypt, started his rule in 1805. He shortly began extensive development projects throughout the country. Muhammad Ali’s efforts established the foundations for his grandson, Khedive Ismail (c. 1863-1879), to initiate his own urban development projects. His visit to the “ Paris World Exhibition” in 1867 was one of city’s greatest milestones. Just as Georges-Eugène Haussmann was hired to develop Paris, Khedive Ismail charged Ali Pasha Mubarak with the task of executing a new urban plan for Cairo. Ali Pasha Mubarak himself had received an education in France, and was appointed Minister of Public Works, overseeing Cairo’s urban development. The inauguration of Suez Canal in 1869 was a pivotal stage in Cairo’s development. The old city was left intact, while a new westernized city was developed in parallel to the west, encircling the old one from the north. The “new” city was developed and equipped with spacious squares, bridges, gardens, and lavish palaces. One of its most famous buildings was the khedival Opera, which was a smaller model of Milan’s “Teatro alla Scala”. The city also contained the largest national library in the region. With the turn of the century, Cairo underwent such a transformation as to reflect diverse architectural traditions, bringing together the expertise of French, Italian, German, and Egyptian engineers.","

General Gawhar al-Siqilli successfully invaded Egypt by order of Fatimid caliph al-Mu’izz li-Din Allah in (358 AH / 969 AD), thus starting the Fatimid Period in Egypt (358 - 567 AH/ 969 - 1171 AD). Here, he founded a new capital for the Fatimid Caliphate: Cairo (al-Qahira “the Victorious”), which thus became the fourth capital in Egypt’s Islamic Period, after al-Fustat, al-‘Askar, and al-Qatai‘. He established this new capital to the northeast of its predecessor, al-Qatai‘. Gawhar commissioned al-Azhar mosque in (359 AH/ 970 AD). This was Cairo’s first congregational mosque, and the fourth in Islamic Egypt. The urban plan of Cairo was rectangular in shape, with al-Mu‘izz Street running north-south through its center. The city’s ramparts had eight gates, with two on each side. These were al-Nasr and al-Futuh on the north, al-Barqiyya and al-Qarratin on the east, Zuwaila and al-Farag on the south, and al-Qantara and Sa‘ada on the west. During the Ayyubid Period (567- 648 AH/1171 - 1250 AD), Saladin ordered the construction of the Citadel in (572 AH / 1176 AD) so it could act as both a fortress and as headquarters.

 Cairo entered an unprecedented age of growth and prosperity during the Mamluk Period (648 - 923 AH/ 1250 - 1517 AD). New neighborhoods, such as Bab al-Luq, were built, as were a number of mosques, madrasas (schools), khanqas (hostels for Sufis), wikalas (caravanserais), forts, and sabils (public drinking fountains).

 Al-Fustat – Al-‘Askar – Al-Qata’i

Islam came to Egypt with the conquest of Amr ibn al-‘Aas in (19 AH/ 640 AD). He established a new capital, al-Fustat, with its mosque in (21 AH/ 642 AD). Al-Fustat continued to serve as Egypt’s capital throughout the Umayyad period (38 - 132 AH/ 658 - 750 AD). Then Egypt succumbed to Abbasid rule (132 - 254 AH/750 - 868 AD), centred in Baghdad. The second capital of Islamic Egypt was moved to al-‘Askar. The Abbasids suffered a process of decentralization. Consequently, Egypt was able to gain its independence for the first time during the Islamic period. Its now autonomous ruler, Ahmad Ibn Tulun, founded the Tulunid Dynasty (254 - 292 AH/868 - 905 AD) and established Egypt’s third capital, al-Qata’i. Ibn Tulun’s successors, however, were unable to preserve this independence state for long, which had in its apex extended its rule over the Levant and parts of the northern Arabian Peninsula. The Abbasids once more gained control over Egypt, reverting the capital from al-Qata’i to al-Fustat. Egypt became a subordinate province to the Abbasid Caliphate, which ruled from its headquarters in Baghdad. By then, a new ruling dynasty had emerged in Egypt: the Ikhshids (322 - 358 AH/ 835 - 969 AD).","

The astounding number of well-preserved monuments of the city of Luxor makes it one of the world’s most important archeological sites. Its ancient Egyptian name was “Waset”, but it is better known today by what the ancient Greeks called it: Thebes, or the Thousand-gated Thebes. The modern name “Luxor”, is derived from what the Arabs called it in 641 AD, “al-Aqsur” (the palaces), when they stood in awe of the city’s ancient temples believing they were palaces.

 Already during the Old Kingdom (c. 2686 - 2181 BC), “Waset” was the capital of the 4th Upper Egyptian nome (administrative unit equivalent to a governorate). King Mentuhotep II (c.2055–2004 BC) founder of the 11th Dynasty succeeded in reunifying Egypt after a period of turbulence, and he made Thebes the capital of the country, and it remained so until the reign of the first king of the 12th Dynasty, Amenemhat I (c.1985–1955 BC). Waset was the main center for the worship of the god Amun-Ra. The temple of Karnak became the seat of his throne on earth, and even with the transfer of the capital to Ithet-Tawy (near al-Lisht, between the Faiyum and Memphis) during the 12th Dynasty, Waset retained its great religious status as the center of the worship of Amun-Ra, the king of the gods. Thebes was inscribed by the UNESCO as part of a World Heritage Site in 1979.

Capital of the Empire

Towards the end of the Second Intermediate Period (c.1650 - 1550 BC), when the Hyksos were in control of the Delta, Thebes led the armed struggle against them until its kings were able to liberate the country. During the 18th Dynasty (c.1550 - 1295 BC), Egypt formed a vast empire with Thebes as its capital city.

This new political situation led to an influx of wealth into Egypt from foreign countries. Because of its preeminent position as the seat of the ruling king and the cult center of Amun-Re, Thebes received the largest share of this wealth. It became one of the biggest Egyptian cities, stretching for 4 kilometers in length on the eastern bank of the Nile. The city’s neighborhoods surrounded Luxor Temple in the south and the temples of Karnak in the north.

The hills of the west bank became the last resting place of the city’s inhabitants. Hundreds of tombs of the Theban nobility are spread over several sites such as Sheikh ‘Abd al-Qurna, while the royal tombs are located further west, in the Valley of the Kings. The village of the workmen and artists who made these tombs lay near-by, at Deir al-Medina. Although Thebes lost some of its prestige with the onset of the Late Period (664 - 332 BC) as a result of the capital being moved to the Delta, it still maintained its spiritual aura until the end of the Roman period, in the late 4th century AD.","

Afterlife played an important role in the ancient Egyptian beliefs. The River Nile as well as the agricultural cycle had contributed to their beliefs about rebirth and resurrection. When the deceased cross over to the netherworld known as “Duat” in the ancient Egyptian language, they were reborn again and placed on Ra’s solar boat in order to emerge with him in the day. The dead person was a resurrected Osiris. Preparation for the afterlife began with the mummification process in order to ensure for the deceased his return back to life again while the Judgment began after the funeral and the arrival of the body to the tomb. The heart was weighed against the feather of Maat i.e. the symbol of truth. Those who were righteous will proceed to the fields of “Iaru”, but those of evil hearts will be devoured by the mythical creature “Ammut” who has a body of a hippo and a face of a crocodile and remain in the underworld, tied to a pole and will never emerge into daylight. Osiris was the god of the afterlife and the “Lord of the West”. That was why the dead had to traverse the rivers, lakes, and gates which led to his world. Ra’s solar boat was the means of arriving there. The good were always aided by deities to overcome any difficulties they should encounter on the way. Ancient Egyptians described their afterlife in many texts, some of them were written on the pyramid walls and inside Middle Kingdom coffins and the books of the “Imy Duat” and “Book of the Coming Forth by Day”.

MUMMIFICATION

In popular legend, the first Egyptian to be embalmed and consequently glorified was “Osiris” himself, but the English term ‘mummy’ comes from the Arabic “mumiyah”, meaning “bitumen”. Until the spread of the Osiris cult, complete mummification process was only practised on kings and those closest to him, but from the Middle Kingdom onwards, it was made available to all who could afford it. The dry sandy desert of Egypt had a natural tendency to preserve dead bodies, allowing the body fluids to drain away and preventing the flesh from rotting. The inhabitants of Egypt must have become well aware of this in the Pre-dynastic Period, and they must have regarded the preservation of a corpse as something natural and by extension, desirable and supported by the gods. When burial practices became more elaborate than using the simple ground pit, it must have soon become apparent that in a stone-lined cell (burial chamber) beneath a mastaba, the process of desiccation did not happen and putrefaction was much more likely. Embalming and mummification emerged as the answer to this problem. Linen wrappings were used to cover up the mummy; selected funerary spells and amulets were placed at particular parts of the body or inserted between the layers of the bandaging. The number of layers varied, for instance, the mummy of Tutankhamun had 16 layers. Finally, a mask was prepared to cover the face, and the mummy was ready for interment.","
