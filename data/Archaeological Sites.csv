The most prominent of these is the tomb of the eponymous St. Menas (AD 285–309), whose fame during the late Roman Period made the site a popular destination for pilgrims seeking blessings. Over time, structures were built around the tomb, such as the Baptistery, several churches, baths, houses, wine presses and workshops, in addition to pilgrim quarters and a large square bordered by porticoes with marble columns. The so-called ‘Pilgrims’ Court’ was a gathering point for pilgrims to the tomb. The ancient city and the saint’s tomb were eventually forgotten until they were discovered by the German archaeologist C.M. Kaufmann in the early 20th century. Subsequent archaeological work by missions from the Coptic Museum and Graeco-Roman Museum unearthed remains of the residential quarters of the city. Because of its religious and historical value, the archaeological site of Abu Mina was inscribed on UNESCO’s World Heritage List in 1979.","

The city of Port Sa’id was established in 1859  at the entrance to the Suez Canal.  The streets of Port Sa’id are characterized by their width, symmetry, and intersections. All the streets are parallel to the canal and they lead from the sea to the desert. In this way, the city acquired a European character, inspired by French urban planning. The city was also lit with gas lamps, and in that sense, it was truly a unique city in its time. The area where the city  has established, northeast of the Delta and overlooking the Mediterranean, was known in previous centuries as the city of al-Farma. It was located on the eastern edge of Lake Manzala, in a barren plain between the lake and the dunes. It lay 28 km from Port Sa’id and was one of Egypt’s important fortresses and trade centres.Initially, the city was divided into two main sections, each with its own distinctive features. The first section is the city itself, located directly west of the Suez Canal. Here resided foreign communities as well as a few Egyptian citizens and Arabs. The second section is an Arab city where a larger community of Arabs and Egyptians lived.

 

Port Sa’id’s urban and administrative blueprint has greatly developed since its inception till the end of the Muhammad Ali’s Dynasty. Now it consists of seven neighbourhoods: Port Fouad, al-Sharq, al-‘Arab, al-Manakh, al-Zuhur, al-Dawahi, and al-Janub.

The city also contains a number of important archaeological monuments, including the old al-Fanar building and its adjacent, al-Abbasi Mosque (the mosque of Khedive Abbas Helmi II), the Saint Eugene Church, and the Suez Canal Authority building.

Suez Canal was the project that began in 1840, when Lenin Bek developed a plan to dig a canal running between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. This would provide a shorter, cheaper means of travel from Europe since it allowed big ships to commute between Suez and al-Farma. He suggested the building of some protrusions at the entrance of the canal on the Mediterranean Sea to protect it from the Nile’s sediments, which are dumped on the sea coast. Several other projects developed by several engineers followed.

On January 5, 1856, Sa’id Pasha issued the second concession firman in which he renewed Ferdinand De Lesseps’ concession to dig the Suez Canal. The first concession was released on November 30, 1854, but it did not specify the location of the port.

On April 25th, the International Committee held a meeting that ended with several agreements, including the decision to build a lighthouse at the entrance to guide incoming ships. The committee also decided to establish many workshops and build all the necessary facilities to construct a bridge running from Port Sa’id and across the sea. This would also serve as a dock for ships to unload their goods. On April 21st, 1859, Delessepes arrived in Port Sa’id, accompanied by Monsieur Mogel Bey, General Director, and Monsieur Laroche, along with other project heads, agents, and one hundred and fifty from sailors, workers and drivers. Monsieur De Lesseps determined that the site was suitable for the canal project.

The Suez Canal was inaugurated during the reign of Khedive Ismail, in a ceremony held in 1869. The Suez Canal Company obtained the right to manage the project and share the profits equally with the Egyptian government. This arrangement ended on July 26, 1956, with Jamal Abd al-Nasir’s nationalisation of the Suez Canal Company.","

Kings and princes in Egypt have been buried here since the end of the fourteenth century AD. Therein they constructed mosques and khanqas, annexing their own burials to these structures. Some of these burials, dating to the fifteenth century, display the magnificence of Mamluk architecture. This cemetery houses more than twenty burial domes, nine of which are attached to mosques. Five of these domes were the burial place for sultans. The most famous of these were: the mosque and khanqa of Sultan Farag ibn Barquq; the Khanqa of Sultan Inal; the dome of Jani Bek al-Ashrafi; the dome of Qurqumas; the mosque and Khanqa of Sultan Bersbay; and the madrasa of Qayitbay.

King Snefru chose the rocky plateau of Dahshur to establish his first pyramid to compete with the pyramid of King Djoser in Saqqara but failed to complete it. This first attempt turned into a broken shape, but he built a complete pyramid at a distance from it, called the Red Pyramid. Nearby, the pyramids dating to the Middle Kingdom, starting from the pyramid of King Amenemhat II, are in a bad state. The pyramid of King Senwosret III is surrounded by the tombs of the princesses Sit-Hathor and Ment. As for the Black Pyramid of King Amenemhat III, it is also in poor condition of conservation. Despite the erosion of its stones, it is still standing at a distance from the pyramid of Sneferu. The Egyptian Museum stores the stone pyramidion, the tip of the pyramid. Several other pyramids of the 13th Dynasty were built at Dahshur. ","

Per-Bastet was the capital of the 18th Lower Egyptian nome (province) during the New Kingdom period (c.1550–1069 BC). It was also the capital of the country during the 22nd Dynasty (c.945–715 BC). Its strategic position at the eastern Delta, made it an important trade hub through which travelers could trade caravans to and from the Sinai and beyond. Most importantly, Bubastis was visited by the Holy Family during their journey to Egypt. Per Bastet is also features the temple of Bastet and the statue of Queen Meritamun, the once daughter and then wife of Ramesses II (c.1279–1213 BC). In addition, one can also find the remaining pillars of the 6th Dynasty temple of Pepi I (c.2289–2255 BC), a large palace of Amenemhat III (c.1855–1808 BC), and remains from a well dating to the Roman Period.

Tell Basta has a long history of excavations undertaken by both Egyptian and foreign missions. Édouard Naville excavated the temple of Bastet between 1887 and 1889. Labib Habachi discovered the temple of Pepi I in 1939. A colossal palace of Amenemhat III was excavated by the teams of the Supreme Council of Antiquities and Zagazig University directed by Shafiq Farid in the 1960s, by Ahmed el-Sawi around a decade later, and then by Mohammed Ibrahim Bakr in the late 1970s and 1980s.","

The Ptolemaic and Roman Period tombs of the city’s residents dating up to the 4th century AD are located in the hill nearby. Above the tombs are the limestone quarries from which the temple’s stones blocks were sourced. Major excavations of the archeological site of Athribis were undertaken by William Flinders Petrie in 1906–1907, by the Egyptian Antiquities Authority in 1981–1997, and by the Egyptian-German mission in 2003–2012.The temple of Ptolemy XII is one of the most important temples in the site; Completed by the Roman emperors Tiberius until Hadrian, the temple suffered an earthquake that caused it to destroy and was used for several purposes, the inner walls of the temple are surrounded by the 26 column, and it has a unique design in Egyptian architecture. The walls of the Holy of holies depicted the unique procession of daily gods, representing a day of the Egyptian calendar, each carrying a vase in the form of a hawk's head topped by a sun disk.

The Temple of Ptolemy IX is located to the west of the Temple of Ptolemy XII; The temple was dedicated to the worship of the Meen-Ra temple, and the temple is still buried under the sand and its gate found in 1983, linking the two temples to a floor of stone tiles.

The archaeological site includes the rock temple of Ascalpius, which consists of a court, a stone façade, and two halls carved into the rock, the temple dated the end of the Ptolemaic period based on its decoration.

The excavations of the temple also revealed the remains of a Coptic Basilica Church in the south side, three longitudinal corridors divided by two rows of columns that could be dated by breaking the pottery found to the 5th and 6th centuries AD.

This site includes some of the most impressive tombs of the Middle Kingdom. Its rich and well-preserved tombs attest the economic prosperity that it enjoyed. The tombs are located in two distinct areas: the upper and lower cemeteries. The lower cemetery contains around 800 tombs, many of them shaft tombs. It mostly contains tombs of various officials from the First Intermediate Period (c.2181–2055 BC) to the Middle Kingdom (c.2055–1650 BC), but late Old Kingdom (c.2345–2181 BC) tombs, like Ipi’s, have also been discovered. The upper cemetery includes 39 rock-cut tombs, which were cut horizontally into the rock face of the cliffs. The walls of 12 of these tombs are decorated with beautifully painted scenes depicting activities of daily life, from agriculture and crafts to hunting and playing games, and also war and the arrival of foreigners on Egyptian lands. The tombs of the upper cemetery are a testament to the ancient Egyptians’ architectural skills. They were cut into the rock with great accuracy using simple tools like chisels with bronze blades, which were struck with wooden mallets. The tombs are the final resting places of the senior officials of this region, the 16th Upper Egyptian province, which was known as the Oryx nome. They date to the 11th and 12th Dynasties of the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1795 BC). The repetition of names like Baqet, Khety, and Khnumhotep through a number of generations suggests that many of the owners of these tombs were related","

Both men agreed that the site was perfect for Baron Empain’s city of dreams, which he sought to build east of Cairo and overlooking the old city, specifically near Matariyya. This vision was one of the most successful architectural executions witnessed by the twentieth century. This vision turned the desert into a lively neighborhood fully furnished with services and encompassing different groups of society. Heliopolis was also the crucible of several new and innovative architectural styles, which merged the Islamic designs with the Hindu and European aesthetics. Baron Empain’s palace, which took five years to complete(1907 to 1911), is a testimony to this diversity, as its French architect, Alexander Marcel, was inspired by Cambodian temples. The beautiful city of Heliopolis was designed not only designed to revive Egypt’s rich Islamic heritage. Rather, Baron Empain and Boghus Nubar had the intention of creating a global, comprehensive city, which included Muslim, Christian, and Jewish sites.  ","

It was cut into the living rock by King Ramesses II (the Great) of the Nineteenth Dynasty, around 1264 BC. The temple is most well known for the four imposing seated colossal statues that dominate its façade. One of these collapsed because of an ancient earthquake, and its fragments can still be seen on the ground.           Colossal standing statues of the king line the main hall, leading to the sanctuary where four deities are sat: Amun‑Ra, Ra‑Horakhty, Ptah, and a deified version of Ramesses II. The temple was built with such precision that on two days a year, the 22nd of February and 22nd of October, the sun’s rays enter the temple, cross the main hall, and illuminate the innermost statues. These dates are thought to correspond to the coronation and birthday of Ramesses II.           Another rock-cut temple to the north, known as the Small Temple, is dedicated to the goddess Hathor and Ramesses II’s Great Royal Wife, Queen Nefertari. On the façade of the Small Temple, her colossi are the same size as those of her husband, a very rare example of such display. The two temples were moved from their original location in 1968 after the Aswan High Dam was built, which threatened to submerge them. The relocation was completed thanks to an international effort led by UNESCO, and the temple was admitted into the list of World Heritage Sites in 1979.","

The most prominent of these is a temple begun by Ptolemy II Philadelphus (285–246 BC), which he dedicated to Isis, the mother of Horus, the god of kingship. A scene in mammisi, or birth room, where the birth of Horus was celebrated, depicts Isis suckling her son Horus in the marshes.             The temple of Isis was one of the last ancient Egyptian temples to remain active, as it continued to function until the reign of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I (527–565 AD), who ordered the foreclosure of all pagan temples. It is here that a priest of Isis named Esmet-Akhom carved the very last dated hieroglyphic inscription, which dates to the late 4th century AD (394 AD). The temple was converted into a Christian church and many inscriptions were deliberately destroyed. Nearby, there also is a temple dedicated to Hathor built by Ptolemy VI Philometor (180–145 BC) and Augustus, the first emperor of Rome (30 BC–14 AD). The Kiosk of Trajan (98–117 AD), which used to front the temple complex of Philae, still stands strong, despite its roof having disappeared. Its regular arrangement of columns made it an aesthetic delight and was regularly described or depicted by travelers to the island. Isis is once again central to this cult, as the emperor is shown making offerings to her, her consort Osiris, and their son Horus.All these monuments were relocated from the original Philae island to the nearby island of Agilkia during the UNESCO Nubia Campaign in the 1960’s to rescue sites flooded by the construction of the Aswan High Dam.","

This was where the cult of the great god Amun of Thebes was conducted. As such, it was extremely wealthy and its priesthood held great political power.            Thebes was the city that the line of kings who reunified Egypt after the First Intermediate Period hailed from. It thus became one of the most important cities, a position that it would continue to hold throughout the majority of ancient Egyptian history. The importance of Amun rose in tandem with the city’s rise to prominence. From the earliest evidence for it from the reign of Intef II (c.2112–2063 BC), before even the beginning of the Middle Kingdom (c.2055–1650 BC), to the Graeco-Roman Period (332 BC–395 AD), this temple was accordingly lavished with royal attention in the form construction projects, ritual equipment and other necessities. Nearly every king from the New Kingdom (c.1550–1069 BC), Egypt’s age of empire, left his mark here.            The temple is located on the east bank of Luxor. Like most ancient Egyptian temples, it is built on an east–west axis. Ancient Egyptian temples were models of the cosmos, and this layout meant that they mirrored the sun god’s trajectory through the sky. Rather uniquely, however, it also possesses a north–south axis, which orients it towards another temple, the abode of Amenemopet known today as Luxor Temple. This was a different version of Amun specific to south Luxor. The two temples were linked by a processional way lined with sphinxes. This was used in one of the most important celebrations of the ancient Egyptian calendar, the Opet Festival.    In addition to the ancient Egyptians’ mastery of stone, which is evident everywhere in the scale of the monuments, the reliefs covering their walls, and the statues populating them, several highlights are worth mentioning. The world-famous Great Hypostyle Hall is a forest of 134 columns. These massive columns have a height of 15 meters, aside from the larger, central, twelve, which stand 21 meters tall. The hall may have been begun by Amenhotep III (c.1390–1352 BC; Eighteenth Dynasty), but the decoration is from the reigns of Nineteenth Dynasty kings Sety I (c.1294–1279 BC) and his son Ramesses II (c.1279–1213 BC). A magnificent obelisk of Hatshepsut (c.1473–1458 BC) in a nearby hall stands at a colossal height of nearly 30 meters. At the eastern end of Karnak is the Akhmenu, a temple by Thutmose III (c.1479–1425 BC) dedicated to the cults of various deities, his royal predecessors, as well as his own cult.

          Karnak was in reality a complex of temples. The enclosure walls include a full temple to Khonsu in the south-western corner, next to which is the Opet temple, which was built in the Graeco-Roman Period for Opet, a hippopotamus goddess of childbirth. The beautiful sacred lake, where priests purified themselves before carrying out temple rituals, can still be appreciated today. Many more, smaller, temples and chapels dot the landscape of Karnak, making it a veritable open-air museum.","

This moniker is not entirely accurate, however, since some members of the royal family aside from the king were buried here as well, as were a few non-royal, albeit very high-ranking, individuals. The Valley of the Kings is divided into the East and West Valleys. The eastern is by far the more iconic of the two, as the western valley contains only a handful of tombs. In all, the Valley of the Kings includes over sixty tombs and an additional twenty unfinished ones that are little more than pits.            The site for this royal burial ground was selected carefully. Its location on specifically the west side of the Nile is significant as well. Because the sun god set (died) in the western horizon in order to be reborn, rejuvenated, in the eastern horizon, the west thus came to have funerary associations. Ancient Egyptian cemeteries were generally situated on the west bank of the Nile for this reason.             The powerful kings of the New Kingdom were laid to rest under the shadow of a pyramid-shaped peak rising out of the cliffs surrounding the valley. The selection of even the specific valley in which the royal tombs were excavated was not left to chance. The pyramid was a symbol of rebirth and thus eternal life, and the presence of a natural pyramid was seen as a sign of the divine. This entire area, and the peak itself, was sacred to a funerary aspect of the goddess Hathor: the “Mistress of the West”.  The isolated nature of this valley was yet another reason for its selection as the final resting place of Pharaoh. Tomb robberies occurred even in ancient times. The Egyptians were of aware of this and the fate of the Old and Middle Kingdom pyramids, and opted for hidden, underground tombs in a secluded desert valley. The first New Kingdom ruler that is confirmed to have been buried in the Valley of the Kings was Thutmose I (c.1504–1492 BC), the third king of the Eighteenth Dynasty. According to Ineni, the high official who was in charge of the digging of his tomb: “I oversaw the excavation of the cliff-tomb of his Person [the king] in privacy; none seeing, none hearing.”","

Made up of three man-made terraces that gradually rise up toward the sheer cliff face, this structure is truly a sight to behold. The site of Deir al-Bahari was sacred to Hathor, the goddess who nursed and reared every king, including their mythological ancestor, the god Horus, in Egypt’s primordial past. A manifestation of this goddess was believed to reside in the very hills under whose shadow lies the temple of Hatshepsut, and just on the other side of which is the site of the tombs of some of ancient Egypt’s most famous rulers, the Valley of the Kings. Stelae bearing prayers to Hathor depict her, in cow form, emerging from these mountains. This impressive geological formation features a summit that is naturally pyramid-shaped. This was the reason why king Nebhepetre Mentuhotep (c.2055–2004 BC) chose this hallowed location as the site of his tomb and mortuary temple, 600 years before Hatshepsut set foot here. Royal mortuary temples complemented tombs, and the cults of deceased kings were maintained in these structures for the continued survival of their souls in the hereafter. The most prominent feature of Mentuhotep’s temple-tomb was a monumental structure, believed by some to have been a pyramid, which rose from the center of the main terrace. The temple of Hatshepsut served as a mortuary temple for the female pharaoh and her revered father, Thutmose I. Sunset was regarded as the daily death of the sun god before his glorious rebirth in the east. Given its funerary nature, Hatshepsut’s mortuary temple was built on the west bank of the Nile, directly across the river from the main temple of Amun in Karnak. The statues of this god, his wife Mut, and their son Khonsu left their temples every year during the Beautiful Feast of the Valley, and crossed the Nile to visit the royal mortuary temples, including Hatshepsut’s, which appears to have been one of their most important stops.","

Each of these spectacular structures served as the final resting place of a king of the 4th Dynasty (c.2613–2494 BC). The Great Pyramid of Giza was built for king Khufu (c.2589–2566 BC), and the other two for Khafre and Menkaure, his son and grandson. Khufu’s pyramid is both the oldest and largest of the three, and the first building to exceed it in height would not be built for another 3,800 years!           Although the three pyramids dominate the plateau, they are in fact surrounded by many other monuments. Every king’s pyramid was just one element—albeit the most important—of a larger complex that included smaller, subsidiary, queens’ pyramids; an additional one that acted as a second, symbolic, tomb for the king, called a satellite pyramid; mastaba tombs for nobility and other family members; burials of actual and/or symbolic boats; and a pair of temples linked by a richly decorated causeway. One of these temples, called the valley temple, led into the pyramid complex, and was located on or near a body of water where boats could dock. The other, the funerary (or upper) temple, stood near the base of the pyramid. Priests maintained the mortuary cult of the deceased king in these temples, where his divine aspect was worshipped, and where rich and diverse offerings were presented to his soul so he could have a peaceful and luxurious afterlife.

The name of the site most likely derives from the god of this necropolis, Sokar.           Saqqara is truly an open-air museum, one that has all of ancient Egyptian history on display. Kings and noblemen from the very first two dynasties (c.3100–2686 BC) were buried here, and this is also the location of the Step Pyramid of Djoser (c.2686–2613 BC), the world’s oldest monumental structure entirely made of stone.           The pyramids of some of the most important kings of the Old Kingdom Fifth (c.2494–2345 BC) and Sixth (c.2345–2181 BC) Dynasties are located in Saqqara. One of these, the pyramid of Unas (also known as Wenis; c.2375–2345 BC), features the oldest pyramid burial chamber decorated with texts. These are the so-called Pyramid Texts, the purpose of which was to protect the deceased king on his journey to the afterlife. In addition to Old Kingdom royal burials, Saqqara is also full of the tombs of the noblemen of this period, which are decorated with scenes and texts of outstanding beauty and craftsmanship.  Saqqara also features tombs from the First Intermediate Period (c.2181–2055 BC), Middle Kingdom (c.2055–1650 BC), and New Kingdom (c.1550–1069 BC). The New Kingdom tombs display an architectural style completely different from their Upper Egyptian counterparts in Thebes. Among them is the tomb of none other than Horemheb (c.1323–1295 BC), the non-royal individual, the general, who became king. He was never buried here however, for, upon ascending the throne, he built a new tomb in the Valley of the Kings worthy of his royal rank.

          Among the most important of Saqqara’s monuments is the Serapeum, a series of underground galleries in which the Apis Bulls were buried from the Eighteenth Dynasty (c.1550–1295 BC) to the Ptolemaic Period (332–30 BC). The Apis Bull was considered an incarnation of Ptah himself, one of the most important gods of Memphis, and as such, there was only ever one Apis Bull at a time. When it died, it was buried with full honors until his successor could be found.

          Egypt’s Coptic era is featured in Saqqara as well through the remains of the Monastery of Apa Jeremiah, which was in use until the tenth century AD. Today, Saqqara is also the site of the Imhotep Museum, in which objects from the site’s immense chronological span are displayed.","

Its strategic location on the Muqattam Hills gave it a formidable defensive position, and offered, as it still does today, an unrestricted panoramic view of Cairo.           Sultan Salah al-Din al-Ayyubi was the first to order the construction of a fortress over the Muqattam Hills (572–579 AH / 1176–1183 AD), but it was not completed during his lifetime. This was achieved during the reign of Sultan Kamel ibn al-Adel (604 AH/1207 AD) who decided to reside in it, making it the official residence of the rulers of Egypt. In the mid-nineteenth century, Khedive Ismail moved the official residence to ‘Abdeen Palace in downtown Cairo.           The Citadel acted as the backdrop to some of the most significant events in Egyptian history from the time it was built to the end of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty, which was in power from the early nineteenth century until the 1952 revolution, when the modern Egyptian republic was born. Many monuments were added to the Citadel over the centuries, providing visitors today with an array of places to visit, such as the Mosque of Muhammad Ali Pasha, which dominates the Citadel. Other places to visit include the mosque of the Mamluk sultan al-Nasir Muhammad ibn Qalawun (built in 718 AH / 1318 AD), the Ottoman-era Sulayman Pasha al-Khadim Mosque (built 935 AH / c.1528 AD), as well as a number of museums such as the Police Museum, Al-Jawhara Palace Museum, the Royal Vehicle Museum, and the Military Museum.","

It was given several names throughout its history, such as the Black Square and al‑Remela Square. It was subject to several phases of destruction by Mamluks and subsequent sultans. It was Muhammad ibn Qalawun who renovated the complex since it served as a polo court for him and his princes on Tuesdays and Saturdays. During his reign, Salah al‑Din Square was the venue for the prayers of the two most important Islamic festivals, Eid al‑Fitr and Eid al‑Adha. Ibn Qalawun also used the square as a reception area for ambassadors and foreign envoys, as well as a hall for celebrations and military parades. The square overlooks Bab al‑‘Azb on the east,  and al‑Rifa’i Mosque and the Mosque and Madrasa of al-Sultan Hasan on the west.

Many princes lived in al‑Saliba and built military installations, including a military school and weapon and rifle workshops.           A vast range of Islamic buildings can be found along just this one street, including mosques, schools, kuttabs (Quran teaching schools), sabils (public water fountains), khanqas (Sufi gathering locations), hammams (baths), and palaces. The whole street is an open‑air museum to Islamic Cairo in its entire splendor. Among the most important monuments on the street are Ahmed ibn Tulun Mosque, Bayt al-Kritliyya, and Sabil-Kuttab Um 'Abbas.","

Al‑Suyufiya reflects the historical developments of the surrounding area. In the beginning of its history, it was part of the city of al-Qatai‘, and it witnessed the architectural development that took place during the Fatimid Caliphate (297–567 AH / 969–1171 AD). During the Ayyubids (564–650 AH / 1171–1250 AD), al‑Suyufiya was surrounded by groves, and partially overlooked Birkat al‑Fil (“Elephant Pond”). The construction of Salah al‑Din’s Citadel in 572 AH/1176 AD catalyzed urban expansion onto the street, and subsequently, in the Mamluk Period (648–922 AH / 1250–1517 AD), the street became the home of the Mamluk nobility and ruling class. This continued during the Ottoman Period (1517–1805 AD) and Muhammad Ali Dynasty (1805–1953 AD). Al‑Suyufiya Street includes a group of different Islamic monuments, such as palaces, mosques, takiyyas, domes, and shrines, all of which date back to different time periods. The most famous of those is the Palace of Prince Taz and the Mawlawi Takeyya.  ","

Fustat, or al-Fustat, was founded by general ‘Amr ibn al-‘As a year later, making it  Egypt’s first Islamic capital. The city got its name from the word fustat, meaning “tent”, after the camp set up by the army of ‘Amr ibn al-‘As in the future location of the new capital. Al-Fustat’s very first building was the mosque of Amr ibn al-‘As, which is also known as al-‘Ateeq ""the Old (Mosque)”, which was built on the site of the tent in which most of the companions of the Prophet Muhammad gathered. Today, al-Fustat is a part of the Old Cairo District. It is one of the most deep-rooted places in Greater Cairo, as it contains many archaeological sites, such as the Synagogue of Ben E'zra, more than seven old churches, the Mosque of ‘Amr ibn al-‘As, the excavated remains of the old city of al-Fustat, the Nilometer on al-Rhoda island, the palace of al-Manesterley, and Mohammad Ali Palace in al-Manyal.","

An ancient Egyptian town or city by the name of Raqote appears to have already existed here. After Alexander’s death in Babylon in 323 BC, his generals fought amongst themselves for control over various territories of the empire. Ptolemy I Soter (305–285 BC) took control of Egypt, initiating the Ptolemaic Period (332–30 BC), which would end with the famous Cleopatra VII. Alexandria became the seat of Ptolemaic rule, and remained the largest and most important city in the eastern Mediterranean until Constantinople’s rise to prominence starting the 5th century AD. One of the major monuments that may be seen in Alexandria today is the towering and massive Diocletian’s Column (late 290s AD), which is more famously—but incorrectly—known as Pompey’s Pillar. It stands immediately next to the site of the Serapeum, the principal temple of Sarapis, the national god of ancient Egypt during this period. It was unfortunately destroyed when the Byzantine Emperor Theodosius outlawed paganism in 391 AD. Many others of Alexandria’s most famous monuments have unfortunately not survived either, such as the Great Lighthouse, the Library of Alexandria, and the Tomb of Alexander the Great. The majority of Alexandria’s surviving monuments are its necropoleis (cemeteries). The most impressive of these is the Roman-era Kom al-Shoqafa near the Serapeum. This contains Greek-style catacombs and triclinia burials, a chapel, and a banqueting area that was used during funerals. Paintings and reliefs gracefully combine ancient Egyptian and Greek beliefs and artistic traditions.

The most impressive surviving non-funerary site is Kom al-Dikka. The monuments that can be seen here, which date to the late Roman to Byzantine Periods, include a theater building (odeion), a very large bath complex, lecture rooms (auditoria), elite houses featuring gorgeous mosaics, and workshops.

The ancient city has suffered greatly throughout its history. It was destroyed by Queen Zenobia of Palmyra in 259 AD, and endured several major earthquakes in Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages. However, the glory of this city and its many monuments have survived in the memory and writings of Greco-Roman travellers and, more recently, underwater archaeology has begun to reveal the structures and colossal statues associated with the Ptolemaic harbour and coastal royal headquarters.","

Commonly known as Saint Catherine’s Monastery, its actual name is the “Sacred Monastery of the God-Trodden Mount Sinai”. It was built by the order of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I (527–565 AD) in 548–565 ADin order to house the monks that had been living in the Sinai Peninsula since the 4th century AD.             The eponymous Saint Catherine of Alexandria was martyred in the early 4th century AD. The monastery bears her name because its monks discovered her incorrupt body on nearby Mount Saint Catherine in the 9th century AD, where it had been deposited by angels after her martyrdom.             The monastery encompasses multiple structures, the most important of which is the Church of the Transfiguration of Christ the Savior, which itself contains nine smaller churches. One of these is the Church of the Burning Bush, from which God had spoken to the prophet Moses. Saint Catherine’s Monastery also includes ten other churches, the monks’ accommodations, a refectory, an olive press, ossuaries, a Fatimid mosque from the 12th century AD, and a library that boasts rare books and6,000 manuscripts.","

The Greeks called this town “Heliopolis”, referring to the Greek god of the sun Helios, as the Egyptian sun god Ra was worshipped in the main temple. It is one of the oldest capitals of the world. Little of the ancient town or temples were preserved. Still, many blocks have been found in the area and reused in the houses of Cairo during Islamic times. The town is still excavated nowadays. The cemeteries preserved tombs of the Old Kingdom, including the tombs of Panhesy and Khonsu-ankh. It is likely that the temple, now destroyed, was as large as the temple of Karnak dedicated to Amun in modern Luxor. There, the priests were in charge of recording the passing of the solar year, establishing the Egyptian calendar and chronology. The obelisk of Senwosret I dating to the 12th Dynasty (1956-1911 BC) remains standing on the site. Obelisks were sun rays represented in stone, thus a regular symbol for the sun god in ancient Egypt. Many obelisks from local temples were likely relocated by Greeks and Romans in the ancient world. A granite and sandstone column built by king Merenptah (1213-1203 BC) was discovered dismantled. It was transported, rebuilt and exhibited in the Grand Egyptian Museum. Thanks to the discovery of texts related to the cult, the influential role of Heliopolis in the Pharaonic religious life is well-known. The sun god Ra-Atum was associated with one of the ancient Egyptian theories of creation. This god sat on the original mound that emerged from the flooding waters “Nun”, and started creating other gods of the air, Shu and Tefnut. From these air gods, the earth Geb and the sky Nut emerged, initiating the world's creation.","
