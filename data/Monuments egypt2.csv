It was called “bent” because of its broken lines due to a change of angle, an engineering issue in its design. Indeed, the pyramid construction began at an angle of 55 degrees but had to be adjusted to 43 degrees due to an overload in stones resulting in instability. Despite their adjustments, the King’s designers made a new pyramid at a short distance, in Meidum, the Red Pyramid. The first angle of the Bent Pyramid suggests the transition phase between the Step-pyramid design of King Djoser in Saqqara and the later smooth-faced pyramids. The Bent Pyramid has two entrances, one on the north side, with modern wooden stairs, and the other is high on the west side. Each entrance leads to a chamber with a corbelled roof, giving this gradual effect. The northern entrance chamber is below ground level.

It is considered one of the most important monasteries established during Christianity’s early history. Because of the red bricks that make up most of its masonry, it is known as the Red Monastery. White limestone was employed in the building’s construction as well as were several pink and black granite columns. The monastery was founded by Saint Bishoy in the beginning of the fourth century AD, but suffered of two fires, the first was during the Roman Period, and the second was as a result of Berber attacks. All that remains of the Red Monastery is its church and surrounding fortification walls to the south. Remains of a structure north of the church also survived and are thought to belong to an industrial area. The main church is composed of a long rectangular space composed of three wings. The middle wing is the largest of the three. A church known as the “Church of the Virgin Mary” is attached to its south-west corner. On its eastern end, the monastery’s church terminates in a tripartite structure decorated with murals done with tempera paint depicting Biblical scenes that include Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, the Four Gospels, and the Apostles.
The fort occupies the area south of the church, to which its structures are attached. It likely dates to the reign of Empress Helena.
It is a roughly square building that consists of four floors, the ground and first floors of baked bricks, and the top two of simple sun-dried mud brick. The fort itself contains several units that allowed the monks to reside in it for long stretches of time, including a church, cells, a storage room, and a water source. ","

The palace reflects the high status of its owner and marks a major milestone in the urban landscape of Heliopolis. Baron Empain's palace is the most prominent Monuments in the capital, its unique and innovative image attracting crowds of pedestrians on the road. It was founded by Edward Louis Joseph Empain between 1907 and 1911. He was a Belgian businessman who was awarded the title ""Baron"" by the King of Belgium, on account of his economic contributions. The French architect Alexander Marcel was tasked with building this masterpiece. The interior design of the palace consists of three floors topped by a roof. The palace is surrounded by a large garden from all sides. As for the basement, it contained a residence for the palace's servants, and consisted of a group of rooms connected by corridors and doors. The palace building is surrounded by a spiral staircase and an elevator that connects all the palace floors with a basement.
The ground floor consists of a reception room, a dining room, and a billiard room. As for the first floor, it houses four rooms, each with its own balcony and bathroom.  Finally, the roof of the palace comes as an open space on one of the sides of the tower, characteristic of the Baron Palace.   ","

It is the only remaining gate of the southern wall of the city’s Fatimid phase. It opens onto the historic al‑Mu’izz Street, which leads to Bab al‑Futuh at its northern end. Built by the Fatimid vizier and commander‑in‑chief, Badr al‑Jamali, in 480 AH/1092 AD, it defined Cairo’s new southernmost extent, displacing the original, brick, Bab Zuwayla (now lost). Its builder, the Fatimid commander of the armies, was Jawhar al‑Siqilli, who conquered Egypt and founded Cairo. Among his troops were members of the eponymous tribe of Zuwayla, who were quartered near the gate. The minarets were not added until 818 AH/1415 AD, when the Mamluk Sultan al‑Mua'yyad Shaykh built a mosque next to Bab Zuwayla.           Bab Zuwayla was also known as Bawabbat al‑Mitwalli, because the mitwalli al‑hesba, the official in charge of finances and tax collection, was based here. According to local folklore, the spirit of al‑Mitwalli ""one of the righteous friends of Allah"", resides in this area, and performs miracles.           Bab Zuwayla witnessed the end of Mamluk rule when the Ottoman Sultan, Selim I, hanged the last Mamluk Sultan, Tumanbay in 922 AH/1517 AD.

The construction of the mosque was begun by al‑Hakim’s father, the Fatimid Caliph al‑‘Aziz bi‑Allah in 379 AH/989 AD, but he died before its completion, leaving his son to finish it in 403 AH/1013 AD. The mosque is located at the end of al‑Mu’izz Street in al‑Jamaliya district, between Bab al‑Futuh and Bab al‑Nasr.           The main entrance lies on the western side of the mosque, and is monumental in size and design. It is one of the oldest architectural examples of projecting stone porches, and was influenced by the great Mosque of Mahdiya in Tunis. The mosque once served as a Shiite center in Egypt, and is comparable to the role al‑Azhar Mosque would later play for Sunni Islam.           The mosque has a long and intriguing history, including its role as a barracks during the French campaign, when its minarets were utilized as watch-towers. Originally, the mosque was constructed as an enclosure by the Fatimid Vizier Gawhar al‑Siqilli (d. 382 AH/992 AD), and was later incorporated into the fortifications built by the general Badr al‑Jamali (d. 487 AH/1094 AD). The plan of the mosque consists of an irregular triangle with four arcades centering a courtyard. Two minarets flank either side of the façade, and they have undergone several restoration phases throughout their lifetime.  ","

It opens onto the historic al‑Mu’izz Street, which leads to the only surviving southern gate of the city, Bab Zuwayla. It was built by the vizier and commander‑in‑chief, Badr al‑Jamali, during the reign of the Fatimid Caliph al‑Mustansir Billah. This stone structure was built farther north than the older, brick, gate of Jawhar al‑Siqilli, thus both giving the city room to expand, as well as tougher defenses. Bab al‑Futuh and Bab al‑Nasr, both of which were built in 480 AH/1087 AD, along with Bab Zuwayla (480 AH/1092 AD), are among the rare examples of military architecture in the Islamic world prior to the Crusades.           As its dating inscription attests, this gate was founded as Bab al-Iqbal (Gate of Prosperity), but the inhabitants of Cairo continued to refer to it by the name of the older monument it replaced, Bab al‑Futuh. The two towers of the gate have rounded fronts, and are linked by a platform, which features shafts in its floor through which boiling oil could be poured on invaders. The arch is splayed, and decorated with a lattice of diamonds, each containing a sculpted shape. Also worth noting are the beautifully decorated corbel stones above the arch. The two at either end terminate in ram heads, symbolizing al‑Qahir (Mars), which was on the ascendant upon the founding of Cairo. This gave the new city its name, al‑Qahira “The Conqueror”.

Bab al‑Nasr, along with Bab al‑Futuh and Bab Zuwayla, is among the rare examples of military architecture in the Islamic world prior to the Crusades.           The current Bab al‑Nasr displaced an earlier, brick, gate constructed by Jawhar al‑Siqilli, Cairo’s founder. Deeming it insufficient for the protection of the city, Badr decided to construct a new, stone, tower, which he sited farther north, thus also giving Cairo more room to expand. Although this new structure was founded as Bab al‑‘Izz (Gate of Glory, or Power), it continued to be known by the name of the old tower, Bab al‑Nasr.           Around halfway up the height of the gates, running along the bottom of the cornice, is the monument’s dating inscription. It is written in Kufic, and masterfully executed in raised relief. It identifies the gate’s official name, and the year in which it was founded.           A series of shields worked in raised relief adorns the outer face of the gate and its towers. These are likely suggestive of the protective role of the Fatimid fortifications, which are acting as the shields of the city. ","

It is located in the Citadel’s southern section. The Mamluk sultan, al‑Nasir Muhammad, over the course of his forty‑two‑year reign that was interrupted three times, built more monuments than any other ruler of the Mamluk ruler. He decreed that this mosque be built in 718 AH/1318 AD. After it was completed, however, he demolished it and rebuilt it in 735 AH/1335 AD. This mosque was highly cherished by subsequent Mamluk sultans, and used by the Mamluk occupants of the Citadel.           The mosque is among the most prominent monuments within the Citadel due to its unique style that merges many architectural traditions. The tops of its two minarets and dome were once covered in green tiles, and are influenced by an eastern Islamic style. The inside of the dome is decorated with a bar of Quranic verses, the titles of Sultan al‑Nasir Muhammad, and the date of the building of the second mosque. The ceiling of the mosque is decorated with beautiful geometric shapes. The ornate minbar (pulpit) is made of wood, inlaid with ivory and mother‑of‑pearl, and inscribed with the name of King Farouk.           The mosque was used as storage and prison during the British occupation of 1882 AD. This led to its destruction, but it was subsequently restored in 1948 AD.  ","

It was commissioned by the Mamluk sultan Hasan ibn al‑Nasir Muhammad ibn Qalawun sometime between 757 AH/1356 AD and 764 AH/1363 AD, and is located at the end of Muhammad Ali Street, opposite its nineteenth century neighbor al‑Rifa’i mosque in Midan al‑Qal’a (Salah al‑Din Square).           The historian al‑Maqrizi, writing in the fifteenth century, reports on the construction of the mosque, stating that the plagues that affected the population at the time did not put an end to the completion of the mosque. The total cost of the project exceeded one million dinars. Because the project was executed on such a massive scale, it attracted many artisans and craftsmen from different provinces of the Mamluk empire.           Its proximity to the citadel ultimately resulted in its use as a fort by enemies several times throughout its history. Some sultans seriously considered demolishing it because enemy armies would use the mosques high platforms to launch attacks on the citadel.           Like most Islamic monuments in Cairo, this one has also undergone several phases of reconstruction, up until the twentieth century. The interior and exterior domes of the mosque are extremely ornate, and their designs may have been inspired by Armenian art and architecture.           A monumental iwan opens up on each of the four sides of the interior square courtyard. An iwan is a vaulted rectangular space that is open on one side. Doorways at the four corners of the courtyard allow access into four madrasas, educational institutions, where the four Sunni Islamic schools were taught.","

          The house is located just off Salah al-Din (or Maydan al-Qal’a “Citadel Square”) in Cairo, and is considered one of the best-preserved structures exhibiting domestic architecture. It was popularly known as the House of Artists because many artists, such as Ragheb Ayyad and Shadi Abd al-Salam, resided there.
          The house’s architecture was inspired by Ottoman and Mamluk styles. The rooms feature the collections of architectural pioneers such as Ramses Wissa Wassef and the internationally renowned architect Hasan Fathi. Paintings adorn the upper hall depicting Cairo's buildings and parks. The roof of the house looks onto a magnificent landscape of Cairo’s historic urban landmarks.
          The house was neglected towards the end of the 20th century until it was renovated at the turn of the millennium. In the 21st century, Ali Labib House was converted into a museum of architecture, and is where the House of Egyptian Architecture is based.    ","

Construction began in 263 AH/876 AD, and finished in 266 AH/879 AD. Located on Jebal Yashkur, the mosque was meant to serve as the main congregational mosque of ibn Tulun’s new administrative capital, al-Qata’i.
          The building of this mosque was a further step in asserting Ahmad ibn Tulun’s independence from the ʿAbbasid Caliphate. Immediately striking is the mosque’s minaret, which echoes the designs of the ʿAbbasid mosque in Samarra, Iraq. However, the date of its construction is disputed, some suggesting that it was a later addition to the plan.
          The arches and the windows of the mosque’s courtyard contain stucco designs of geometric and foliated designs. A water fountain is positioned in the center of the courtyard, surmounted by a dome supported by marble columns. The interior of the mosque contains six mihrabs. The mihrab is a niche in the wall of a mosque that marks the qibla, the direction of the Kaaba in Mecca, which Muslims face during prayer. The main mihrab is concave, and elaborately decorated.
          In the medieval period, several small houses plotted the mosque’s exterior, some being built right up against the mosque’s walls. For this reason, mosques were often built with an enclosure wall. The resulting empty space between the outer wall and the mosque, called a ziyada, separated the religious world from the secular outside. With the exception of Bayt al-Kritliyya and Beit Amna bint Salim, the structures that had been built up against the outer wall were demolished in the twentieth century. Today, the mosque largely survives in its original form, but is rarely used for congregational prayers.    ","

The structure has two floors: the ground floor contains eight rooms with wooden ceilings, and the second contains eight different rooms of different sizes and purposes.           The Dervish stage, built in 1810 AD, is dedicated to Mawlawi gatherings of dhikr, ”supplication to god”. It is composed of a circular wooden platform surrounded by a wooden handrail which has two doors. Here the dervishes perform circular movements as a form of dhikr. The second floor above this space is reserved for guests and women, and is reached by means of a wooden staircase.  ","

The history of the church is still being debated. Some scholars believe that it dates to the late fourth to early fifth centuries AD, while others believe that it should approximately be dated to 17th century AD.          This church has acquired a special religious status among Coptic churches because it is associated with the Holy Family's journey through Egypt. It is named after renowned early fourth century AD saints, Sergius and Bacchus, both of whom were martyred at al-Resafa in Syria for their Christian beliefs.           Like various other early Christian churches, the Church of Abu Serga and its underground cave are designed in the basilica layout, and thus together consist of three parts: the narthex, nave, and sanctuary (the cave being below the sanctuary). The church is characterized by its unique architectural and artistic elements that reflect the spirit of Coptic church architecture in Egypt. These include the pulpit, baptismal font, inlaid ivory and wood templon, and unique religious decoration of the saints and apostles decorating the various domes, walls and columns.  ","

It was once the center of many celebrations, congregations and prayers, but is no longer in use today. The origin of the building is uncertain. Some believe that it was once a Coptic Orthodox Church that was sold to members of Egypt’s Jewish community in 882 AD. The synagogue is named after Abraham ibn ‘Ezra, the Jewish religious scholar and philosopher.
Ben ‘Ezra contains all the main features of a synagogue. The bimah, or pulpit, from which prayers were read is in its center. The most sacred feature of a synagogue, the hekhal, which marks the direction of prayer, is decorated in Arabesque style and inlaid with mother of pearl, displaying a merge of artistic traditions. The Ten Commandments are inscribed on it in Hebrew.           Every synagogue keeps a geniza, a repository for old documents mentioning the name of God, which could not be simply discarded. Ben ‘Ezra’s was especially large. It had accumulated documents over a span of 850 years. This treasure of historical documents was discovered by Europeans in 1888, and is now housed in libraries around the world. The Cairo Geniza, as it is known today, includes many rare and previously unknown documents.   ","

General ʿAmr ibn al-ʿAs (d. 664) was one of the first companions of the Prophet Muhammad. After conquering Egypt in 19 AH/640 AD, he founded its first Islamic capital, Fustat, which falls within the modern city of Cairo. A year later, by order of the Caliph ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab, he also founded the eponymous mosque of ‘Amr ibn al-‘As, which thus became the new capital’s very first building. During the early years following the conquest, the mosque served as a place of gathering for Muslim community and ‘Amr’s troops, which at the time remained a minority in Egypt. Several of the Prophet’s companions assisted in the building’s construction, including al-Zubayr ibn al-‘Awam and Ubada ibn al-Samit. The structure was subjected to several episodes of destruction, and has therefore undergone many architectural changes throughout its lifetime, such that very little of the original survives today. What currently stands in Old Cairo is the mosque’s twentieth century reconstruction. However, it remains true to the modesty of Islamic architecture in its earliest form, evolving from a shed with palm-tree columns to the elegant arcade halls that still house prayers to this day.

If the flood was too high, the water would cause destruction, and would also eventually recede late in the year, disrupting the agricultural cycle. If it was too low, the soil would not be resupplied with nutrients, and agriculture would be impossible. Both outcomes could result in food shortages, or even famine. Nilometers, as their name suggests, were used to measure flood levels so that dykes, levees, and canals could be prepared accordingly. Flood levels affected agricultural productivity, so another major purpose of Nilometers was to set taxation levels. Built on the order of the Abbasid Caliph al-Mutawakkil in 247 AH/861 AD, the Nilometer on Rawda Island is one of the oldest in Egypt. It is also the oldest structure built after the Arab conquest (20 AH/641 AD) that survives in its original form. The annual seven‑day celebration of the Nile flood, which took place from the medieval period down to the end of the nineteenth century, was attended by the sultan himself along with his senior officials. The Rawda Island Nilometer consists of a marble octagonal column 19 cubits in length in the middle of a stone-lined well that is rectangular at the top, and circular at the bottom. Quranic texts relating to water, vegetation, and prosperity are carved on the walls of the well, as are measuring marks, which were used to determine the height of the flood as the water rose through the well. A stairway spirals down to the bottom. ","

Its valuable collection is a beacon for visitors, who come in reverence to admire its rare relics for their artistic qualities           Currently, it is the smallest surviving monastery of Wadi Natrun and is the most famous amongst clergymen and scholars around the world. Although the monastery’s foundations date back to the fourth century AD, it is known as the Monastery of the Syrians because of a group of al-Surian monks who settled in Wadi Natrun in 984 AD.           The monastery includes a number of monumental buildings including a fortress, a group of monastic cells, and three large churches named the Virgin Mary, the Cave of Virgin Mary, the Church of Archangel Michael.           The Church of the Virgin Mary is the monastery’s main church. Built in 645 AD, it is also its oldest building after the Cave of Anba Bishoy to its west, and features beautiful engravings covering its walls, doors, and domes. In 1994, a team of researchers from the University of Leiden examining the plaster layers covering the walls of the church discovered many frescos (wall paintings) from the seventh to eighteenth centuries AD. Among the depictions are the birth and death of the Virgin Mary, and Jesus Christ carrying her soul.           An extensive and rare collection of Syriac manuscripts was discovered in the monastery’s library during the nineteenth century. This unparalleled collection, currently housed in the Vatican Library and other institutions, includes some of the oldest Greek texts by Aristotle, Euclid, and Hippocrates.","

It was later rebuilt by Emperor Justinian I (527–565 AD), who included it within the much larger church that he built, the Church of the Transfiguration of Christ the Savior. A small altar on a marble floor marks the location of the Burning Bush, directly above its roots.

The Fatimid Caliphate witnessed the peak of this relationship, and the caliphs of the period worked tirelessly to build mosques in sacred locations. The Fatimid mosque in Saint Catherine’s Monastery became a stop for pilgrims on their way to Mecca, many of whose writings can still be seen on its mihrab to this day.             The mosque lies in the north-western sector of Saint Catherine’s Monastery, opposite the Church of the Transfiguration of Christ the Savior, its principal church, such that its minaret stands side-by-side with the church’s steeple, in a perfect symbol of religious harmony. The mosque features several semi-circular vaults and three mihrabs. The mihrab is a semi-circular recess in the wall of a given mosque that indicates the qibla, the direction of the Kaaba in Mecca, which Muslims face during prayer. The principal mihrab is similar in its design to the one in the oldest section of al-Azhar mosque, and has a beautiful minbar, or pulpit, one of only three complete surviving examples from the Fatimid Period.

The 263 known burials range from simple one-chamber structures to elaborate family mausoleums. Built over an ancient Egyptian cemetery, the style of the chapels fuses both Pharaonic and Christian elements. The cemetery began during the 4th century AD, and continued to be in use to the 11th century.             Early Christian burials continued the now-iconic ancient Egyptian tradition of using coffins and burying the deceased with burial goods. These were placed on shelves in pits dug under the chapels. Mummification was practice in this cemetery long after it had died out in the Nile valley.           The Chapel of the Exodus is one of the earliest in the cemetery. The interior of its dome is decorated in two bands illustrating scenes from the Old Testament. Perhaps the most striking of these shows the Exodus—hence the chapel’s name—with Moses leading the Israelites through the Sinai desert, as Pharaoh’s army gives chase. Other scenes depict Adam and Eve, Noah’s Ark, Daniel in the lion’s den, Jonah and the whale, as well as several other episodes from the Old Testament.           Similar themes are depicted on the dome of the Chapel of Peace, including the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary and others. Greek captions identify the scene that is depicted. The interior walls are also painted with many Byzantine frescoes of grape vines, peacocks, allegorical figures, and inscriptions.           Numerous Arabic graffiti dating from the 9th century to the present day can be seen in some of the chapels, including some by Turkish soldiers who are believed to have been garrisoned at Bagawat in the late 18th century.","
